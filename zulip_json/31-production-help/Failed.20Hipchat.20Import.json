Went pretty much without a hitch. However, all of the file attachments are showing broken link(s) despite being located in the directories to which the link is referencing. (For instance https://{myhostname}/user_uploads/1/GqBt9KPBWKVraAGWAbr7LXNC/upload.png shows as a broken link, even though the file exists in /home/zulip/uploads/files/1/GqBt9KPBWKVraAGWAbr7LXNC).<br>\nI tried going in and adding all of the files to the zulip.zerver_attachment table (they weren't in there). But no effect. Is this a bug or am I doing it wrong?</p>",
