(I have a rented root server running Ubuntu 14.04, and on it I have running multiple servers, e.g. mail server, GitLab, ownCloud and some more).</p>\n<p>I don't feel comfortable with the suggested solution of installing zulip in a VM on that remote server (to which I have only access through an SSH terminal). Therefore I'd like to know *if* it's possible at all to install zulip manually as a server among others, manually setting up DB, program etc., and if so, if there's a pointer where to look for documentaiton for such a process.<br>\nIf such a process seems feasible but isn't documented yet I might help with such documentation if I'd be directed through the process.</p>",
