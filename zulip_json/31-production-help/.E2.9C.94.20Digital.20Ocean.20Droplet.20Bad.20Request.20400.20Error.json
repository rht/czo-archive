I thought It was a DNS issue, as I changed the DNS of the TLD, but the only change was in the old domain and not the digital ocean droplet.  The CNAME was updated to reflect the previous settings.  Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated. Currently, does not work at all. <a href=\"http://zu.the101project.com\">zu.the101project.com</a><br>\nthe droplet ip is 161.35.6.144</p>",
