For our Discourse forum I found this wonderfully simple IIS SSO provider where you can delegate the task of identifying users to any random IIS server on your network: <a href=\"https://github.com/laktak/discourse-sso\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/laktak/discourse-sso\">https://github.com/laktak/discourse-sso</a> but it is going to take some effort to adapt it to work with zulip.  The other method I will try is to get auth_kerb working in Apache and use the REMOTE_USER SSO method in zulip. I would love to hear how others have solved this. Authenticating through LDAP might not seem like a big deal but I think automatically logging in my users would encourage them to actively use a new service like zulip.</p>",

If you have good luck with either approach, I'd love some notes on any issues you ran into that we can use to extend the documentation.</p>",
