I have been reviewing the release notes and it seems the big things to watch out for are some settings reorg in 4x and the addition of Smokescreen. Does anyone have any hands on experience or recommendations in an up grade path? Can I go directly from my 3.3 to 5.2 or should I do some intermediate jumps? Currently the OS is Ubuntu 18.04 LTS if that has any effect.</p>",
