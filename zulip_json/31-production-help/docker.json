I found <a href=\"https://github.com/galexrt/docker-zulip\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/galexrt/docker-zulip\">https://github.com/galexrt/docker-zulip</a>, which seems like a good way to start, but I'm a bit confused about how to actually start using it.  I ran <code>sudo docker pull quay.io/galexrt/zulip:1.6.0-1</code> on our server, but don't know how to edit the relevant <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file.  My problem may be a lack of experience with docker, but the tutorials I've found on <code>docker-compose</code> focus on creating a project rather than editing an existing one.  Any help would be appreciated!</p>",
