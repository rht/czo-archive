[Check you can browse to it/Do you use a proxy/Is it a zulip server/Does it have a valid certificate]\"</strong></p>\n<p>I can browse to it from the laptop without issue, we don't use any proxies, obviously it's a zulip server as browsing works and the SSL certificate is valid. I've also tried adding Zulip as an exception within the laptop's firewall. Other computers on the same network are using the desktop client without a problem...</p>\n<p>What's next to try? Thanks</p>",
