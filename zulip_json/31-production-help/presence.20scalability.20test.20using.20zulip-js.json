        "content": "<p>Hello,</p>\n<p>I'm evaluating Zulip for a project where:<br>\n1) we'd like to use the API (namely zulip-js) for our client implementation<br>\n2) we need to create many realms with anywhere from 1 to 500 users per realm<br>\n3) users will be fairly active, both in terms of messaging and presence (we'd like an \"on the phone\" state...)</p>\n<p>To that end, I created a test application using zulip-js that creates a user, registers an event queue (for \"presence\" and \"user_status\"), and then enters a loop where it sets self presence to something new every 20 seconds. (I realize this is a pretty stressful test, but ...  I need to understand bottlenecks). (Also note, I did need to extend zulip-js to support this).</p>\n<p>I'm testing against an instance of Zulip installed per the instructions at <a href=\"https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/install.html\">https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/install.html</a> on a GCP VM instance.</p>\n<p>I'm attaching a screenshot showing 500 instances of my test application running (all users in the same realm). The screenshot is taken <em>after</em> the user creation phase has completed -- so basically at the point where the clients are just flipping presence every 20 seconds.</p>\n<p>The CPU usage is definitely higher than I'd hoped, and I'm wondering about a couple of things:<br>\n1) Is using the API (via zulip-js) a factor here (vs. what we'd see using e.g. the default web interface?)<br>\n2) Am I inadvertently doing something heavy/wrong in my creation of the event queue?
