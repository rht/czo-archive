When a member signs into chat; if they are not registered in zulip it should register them and sign them in.  I have looked at the documentation but have no idea where I am suppose to place any oauth2 client in zulip.  I have poked around in the directories figuring since evil google was built in that I could learn something that way.  No luck.  There is nothing in the documentations about oauth2 that I could find.  A few pointers in the right direction to get me started, please.</p>",
