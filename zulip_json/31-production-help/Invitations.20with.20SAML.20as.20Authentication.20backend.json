Let's take an example. Assume a course organizer with ~50 teaching assistant. The course organizer creates a private stream for the team communication with the teaching assistants. Now, they need to be invited to that stream. An invite link would be really convenient to accomplish this because you already have the email contacts from the applications or you have a private space on moodle or something like that. There, you can post the invitation link and everyone can join without further ado.<br>\nWithout invitation link, you need to manually add the users on Zulip. Ok, I have a bot that can subscribe an existing plain-text list of names to a stream, but there still is the problem how you want to ensure that the right users are invited in case that there are multiple users with the same name. (I have been planning to propose to you for some time now, that users can be <code>@-mentioned</code> in Zulip using an ID from the set of SAML IDs that can be imported using <code>SOCIAL_AUTH_SYNC_CUSTOM_ATTRS_DICT</code> in <code>/etc/zulip/settings.py</code>, but there is some work to do before this is possible, I think...)</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"10349\">@Mateusz Mandera</span> exaclty, this has been the idea!
