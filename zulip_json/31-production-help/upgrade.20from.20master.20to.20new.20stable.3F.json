To be able to import a server previously running on <a href=\"http://zulip.com\">zulip.com</a>, I upgraded to master, as recommended <a href=\"https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/export-and-import.html\">here</a>. I successfully imported, and all is running fine.<br>\nMy question: I installed and upgraded to master on September 11, and version 3.2 was <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/releases\">released on September 15</a>. Is it (a) possible (b) recommended to update to the new release from master?<br>\nMy goal is to have a stable installation that requires as little maintaing as possible.</p>",
