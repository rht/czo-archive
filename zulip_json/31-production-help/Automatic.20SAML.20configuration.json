This would be especially useful for certficate updates.<br>\nCurrently, I configured SAML by using the appropriate settings in <code>/etc/zulip/settings.py</code>. Is there a way to automate this by specifying an url to the IdP's metadata?</p>",

I see that our underlying SAML library has a class for parsing IdP metadata <a href=\"https://github.com/onelogin/python3-saml/blob/master/src/onelogin/saml2/idp_metadata_parser.py\">https://github.com/onelogin/python3-saml/blob/master/src/onelogin/saml2/idp_metadata_parser.py</a> so that should make things simpler if we end up building such a tool in the future.</p>",
