Have you set <code>LOADBALANCER_IPS</code> to the IP address that the container sees the requests forwarded from Traefik as coming from?  Setting that correctly should remove the need to set <code>CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS</code> and should fix the login problem.  It will also fix IP-based rate-limiting and IP addresses in access logs.</p>",
