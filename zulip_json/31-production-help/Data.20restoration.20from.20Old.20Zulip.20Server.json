Let me explain my issue: I was using Zulip 6.1, installed on an Ubuntu Server 20 (on-premises). Due to certain reasons, the company has decided to migrate the server to a different location.</p>\n<p>I've managed to create a new Zulip 6.1 server, but I'm struggling with restoring the backup from my old server but failed due to my limited knowledge of this process. I am urgently seeking assistance in this matter. Our company's chat server is currently down, and my job is at stake.</p>\n<p>Your help in resolving this situation would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your understanding and support.</p>",
