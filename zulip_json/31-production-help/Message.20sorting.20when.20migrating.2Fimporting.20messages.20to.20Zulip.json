I'm doing this by using Element's chat export function (painfully for each channel), feeding the resulting transcripts into a hacky script I wrote that POSTs the messages to a Zulip bot created specifically for preserving this chat history.</p>\n<p>This is all fine, but I'm worried about the scale of work involved in sorting said history. I suspect I will be moving many chunks of discussion into new appropriately titled topics. Though I see the option to \"move only this message\", \"move this and all following messages in this topic\", and \"move all messages in this topic\", I don't see one for precisely choosing multiple messages that don't continue to the end of the topic. Is there a way to accomplish this other than repeatedly moving single messages? I did check to see if dancing on hotkeys in zulip-terminal was an option but it seems moving messages is not implemented there.</p>",

However, this depends on the permission settings, which I believe do not reflect some recent changes in server settings, or possibly if one is an administrator.</p>",

The E2E encrypted nature of the Matrix protocol implies clients are required to decrypt server message data. And the export function in Element is apparently designed to only operate on individual channels. But again, I am less worried about this than the method I will need to employ to sort blocks of discussion into separate Zulip topics.</p>",
