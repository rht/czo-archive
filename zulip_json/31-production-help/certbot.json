I deleted AAAA-record. Nslookup domain name returns the correct address. Firewall turned off. Ports are open. During the installation with the --cerbot switch, an error of an incorrect answer from .well-know occurs constantly (To fix these errors, please make sure that your domain name was   A / AAAA record (s) for that domain contain (s) the right IP address.) What could I miss in server pre-configuration? Should I customize the host and hostname files? Please help ) <span class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" title=\"slight smile\">:slight_smile:</span></p>",

But certbot has a very popular forum with lots of helpful answers).</p>",
