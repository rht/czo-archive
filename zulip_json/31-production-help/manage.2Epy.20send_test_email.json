Setting it up was bumpy but we got there in the end. <br>\nNow we are really looking forward to Zulip 2.0 (by the way, is this Zulip 1.5 here?). <br>\nTo gain a bit of experience with Zulip I wanted to set up a second VM (Ubuntu 16.04.2, Zulip 1.5.1). <br>\nAll the settings are the same as with the first working server but when I run the email test: <br>\nsu zulip
