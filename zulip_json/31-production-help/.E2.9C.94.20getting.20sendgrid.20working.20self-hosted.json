I'm not sure what value to enter into settings.py <code>email_host_user</code>, is it the FROM address? in sendgrid, this has to be a real address (it requires verification and a code). Sendgrid also says not to use gmail addresses (which also failed anyway)</p>\n<p>am i supposed to setup a separate postfix server at my domain? what value do i put in <code>email_host_user</code>?</p>",
