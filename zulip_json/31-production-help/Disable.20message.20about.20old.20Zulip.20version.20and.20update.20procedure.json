We will do this, but need more time to complete the testing. Can this warning be turned off?<br>\nRegarding the update: Can I just update from Zulip 4.10 to the newest 7.4 release, or shall I do updates from Zulip 4.10 --&gt; 5.x --&gt; 6.x --&gt; 7.x? Which is the best and most reliable approach?<br>\nAlso I have configured apt_local to block some automated updates. Must this be turned off for the Zulip update or will the Zulip update procedure take care of it?</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot for your answers and best regards,</p>\n<p>Pascal</p>",
