All other apps that our zulips competition do not offer voice calls too. I want a whats app telegram style chat server zulip seems to be the closest to that that i can find. Your install script is the best too as it automates everything which is really nice. Though i am still stuck and your instructions for installing are vague and maybe missing bits you expect people to know already. Maybe i just need to start again and not smoke weed while doing it haha.</p>",
