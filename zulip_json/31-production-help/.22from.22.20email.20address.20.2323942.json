Note that this is a public-facing email address; it may\n## appear on 404 pages, is used as the sender&#39;s address for many automated\n## emails, and is advertised as a support address. An email address like\n## support@example.com is totally reasonable, as is admin@example.com.\n## Do not put a display name; e.g. &quot;support@example.com&quot;, not\n## &quot;Zulip Support &lt;support@example.com&gt;&quot;.\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I think possibly the main bug here is that the much briefer text in the installation docs for the <code>install --email=</code> command-line parameter does not explain this clearly: <a href=\"https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/install.html#installer-options\">https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/install.html#installer-options</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>--email=you@example.com</code>: The email address of the person or team who should get support and error emails from this Zulip server.
