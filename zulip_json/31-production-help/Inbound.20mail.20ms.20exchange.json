Local delivery: A MTA runs locally and passes mail directly to Zulip\n#  2. Polling: Checks an IMAP inbox every minute for new messages.\n#\n# The local delivery configuration is preferred for production because\n# it supports nicer looking email addresses and has no cron delay,\n# while the polling mechanism is better for testing/developing this\n# feature because it doesn&#39;t require a public-facing IP/DNS setup.\n#\n# The main email mirror setting is the email address pattern, where\n# you specify the email address format you&#39;d like the integration to\n# use.  It should be one of the following:\n#   %s@zulip.example.com (for local delivery)\n#   username+%s@example.com (for polling if EMAIL_GATEWAY_LOGIN=username@example.com)\nEMAIL_GATEWAY_PATTERN = &quot;%s@zulip.eng.nimblestorage.com&quot;\n#\n# If you are using local delivery, EMAIL_GATEWAY_PATTERN is all you need\n# to change in this file.  You will also need to enable the Zulip postfix\n# configuration to support local delivery by adding\n#   , zulip::postfix_localmail\n# to puppet_classes in /etc/zulip/zulip.conf and then running\n# `scripts/zulip-puppet-apply -f` to do the installation.\n</pre></div>",
