I just invited someone as a \"Guest\" user (the option was available in the select box in organisation settings). Now I read the \"billing\" part of the docs [1], which says that \"Guests are only available on [...] on paid plans for Zulip Cloud\".</p>\n<p>Are the docs accurate, despite the config option being available on my free instance? What will happen with the user I invited? Will they still be able to access our instance? Is there an option to just \"unlock\" the guest user feature / pay for the guests, without having to pay for the other users?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance,<br>\nDennis</p>\n<p>[1]:<a href=\"https://zulip.com/help/roles-and-permissions\">https://zulip.com/help/roles-and-permissions</a></p>\n<hr>",
