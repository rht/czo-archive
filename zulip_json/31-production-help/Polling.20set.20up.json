I really appreciate. <br>\nOne more question do you know where I can put the password for the email account?<br>\nIn zulip container, we don't use zulip-secrets.conf this file (or do we)?<br>\nIf we don't use zulip-secrets.conf, do I also store the password in docker-compose.yml?<br>\nWhat is the password line that I need to use to store password?<br>\nFor example, for redis I need to use the following line. <br>\nSECRETS_redis_password: \"this is password\"<br>\nThank you so much again. :)</p>",
