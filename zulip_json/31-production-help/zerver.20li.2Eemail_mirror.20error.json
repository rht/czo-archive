Also, are the two recipients in the <code>To:</code> header or some it another header?</p>\n<p>Our email gateway logic should be able to handle two recipients. I've also just tested it here - <a href=\"#narrow/stream/7-test-here/topic/incoming.20email.20gateway.20test/near/1622856\">https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/7-test-here/topic/incoming.20email.20gateway.20test/near/1622856</a> - and an email with to addresses in <code>To:</code> arrived correctly. So I'm wondering whether this couldn't just be some mistake in the email address in your two recipients case? Or perhaps something more subtle about how your client is constructing the header, that makes our logic fail to parse it</p>",
