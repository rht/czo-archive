There is some kernel strangeness with WSL.

It's an underlying issue with how the NTFS file system under WSL handles open handles to file locations. If there are any open handles the mv command will fail. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/1529\" title=\"https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/1529\">https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/1529</a></p>\n<p>Otherwise, I think Zulip would work on Windows in WSL with minimal issues.
