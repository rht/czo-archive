You mention there having put the secrets <code>/data/zulip-secrets.conf</code> - I'm not super familiar without our current docker set up, but why would docker-zulip pick up the secrets from that specific path in your configuration?</p>\n<p>The other issue is <code>botocore.exceptions.ClientError: An error occurred (SignatureDoesNotMatch) when calling the PutObject operation: Unknown</code> - perhaps the keys configured are wrong or misspelled? Have you also set up bucket policy as described in the doc?</p>",
