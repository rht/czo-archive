NOTE: the old server had this setup with a manual certbot being run inside the zulip container every few months, so zulip's internal nginx was doing the termination.</li>\n<li>I have an external proxy and jrcs/letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion set up to auto-renew letsencrypt and can confirm valid external ssl certs from browser, client and mobile</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Problem: after some period between 1-12 hours, the client looks like it can send messages but the edit-message hover is not there (as if it wasn't confirmed by the server) and a quit/reload causes that sent message to disappear. During this time no other users are receiving all messages either.</p>\n<p>I'm digging through logs but since this is an intermittent problem I'm not sure where to begin. I may just have to go through mulitple YEARS of upgrade procedures just so I can get this problem resolved but was hoping to put that off because I think that's probably even more work.. ugh.</p>\n<p>Any ideas? Open to any direction I can take to speed up my discovery process here and narrow down the problem(s).</p>",
