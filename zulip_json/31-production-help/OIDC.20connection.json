What I found is that when I had my Zulip server and nodejs server connected via Wireguard on a private IP (192.168.2.x), the Zulip logs would complain with this exact 407 error. Once I changed config to use public IP addresses, the issue disappeared.</p>\n<p>Is there something in the code that requires the OIDC server to be on a public IP range? When I was on the Wireguard private network, the Zulip server wasn't even trying to hit the OIDC server. I checked this by enabling the Apache2 forensic module with logging, and nothing was logged from Zulip, compared to using curl directly (on the Zulip server) to get the OpenID configuration from the OIDC server, where I saw an entry in the log.</p>",
