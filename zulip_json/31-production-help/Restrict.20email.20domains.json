But now, I want to give someone access to our Zulip instance who does not yet have the Shibboleth credentials. I thought that I could create a user manually using <code>manage.py</code> and a virtual email address (with the same domain as the Zulip server itself). Then I wanted to enable the <code>EmailAuthBackend</code> and restrict the email addresses to the domain of the Zulp server. This would exclude all emails except the virtual one I created on the server. But this does not work because the SAML authentication would then suffer from the same email address restrictions.<br>\nMaybe you know another way to add a single external user?</p>",

It's probably a relatively small project to get it done so it should on my short term TODO list, but I may not be able to give it proper attention for a bit. If an immediate workaround is needed, and getting the user added in SAML is out of the question for now, I don't really have a better idea than something like setting up a separate auth method for just this user <span aria-label=\"neutral\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f610\" role=\"img\" title=\"neutral\">:neutral:</span>  Could be another SAML IdP, or LDAP with the user being the only one in the directory, or <code>Github</code> with e.g. <code>SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_TEAM_ID</code> restriction where the user is the only member of the team, etc.</p>",
