We only save nginx log file outside of the container. <br>\nAlso, it is true that all log files are under /var/log/zulip inside the container. <br>\nDo you know anyway that I can save those log files outside of container?<br>\nTherefore, we can still access those log files when container is crashed. <br>\nThank you so much. :)</p>",
