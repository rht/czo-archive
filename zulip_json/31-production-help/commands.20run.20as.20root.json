I did it once which led to an awful bug where Zulip changed ownership on the system messing with the DB and other components. No fun, but something easily revertible with <code>chown -R zulip:zulip /home/</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Do you recall what command you ran that did this?  The recommendation of only running things as <code>root</code> if it's absolutely necessary is good advice, but we generally also try to prevent commands from messing things up if run as the wrong user.</p>",

I guess it must have been any of <code>/home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts</code>. </p>\n<p>I suppose I was configuring SMTP and restarted the server as root with <code>/home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/restart-server</code> instead of <code>su zulip -c /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/restart-server </code>.</p>\n<p>I am pretty sure it was a command like this, just not exactly which one. I think it's a quite dangerous trap more people could fall into. We eventually found the error in the logs. I'll have a look tomorrow at work and post it here.</p>",
