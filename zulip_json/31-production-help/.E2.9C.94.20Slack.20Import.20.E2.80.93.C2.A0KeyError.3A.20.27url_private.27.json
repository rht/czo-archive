When I had a look at the variables that were breaking the import,  I noticed that they had the below keys set – no \"url_private\".</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>id -&gt; F0229DWN075\nfile_access -&gt; external_access_denied\ncreated -&gt; 0\ntimestamp -&gt;  0\nuser -&gt; UD2PXA80K\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Since the \"timestamp\" and \"created\" keys are 0, I went on a hunch and ignored these.

Do let me know if what I did was silly, too.  Thank you!</p>",
