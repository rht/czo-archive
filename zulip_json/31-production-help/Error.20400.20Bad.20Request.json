Ive searched about it and ive done what's suggested, having the domain in which it is being served in the SETTING_EXTERNAL_HOST variable, and adding the ip address of the machine in SETTING_ALLOWED_HOSTS as '[\"${ipAddress}\"]' but Im still getting that error. I wanted to ask which IP address Im supposed to add in this variable. I added the public one</p>",

That's why I added it. So that last variable just can't have IPs? What else can I do about the error? I only have the one domain that is supposed to reach zulip, and thats the one in SETTING_EXTERNAL_HOST</p>",

        "content": "<p>sorry for the late reply. Im using an nginx reverse proxy. Im running dockers port 80 and 443 on the host's port 9010 and 9011, though I dont <em>need</em> them there, if using those ports is a problem. If I access localhost:9011 (my server has a GUI), it loads, but js and css dont because it tries to load from the domain which doesnt work. But this means that the containers do run correctly and are serving correctly through those ports. My problem is specifically when using the domain, but it is correctly typed in the docker-compose yml file. This is my nginx config file. I have a file for each service im proxying, so thats why only zulip stuff appears here. All other services im reverse proxying use the same exact thing, except for domain name and ports, and those work</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>server {\n    if ($host = zulip.domain.tld) {\n        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;\n    } # managed by Certbot\n\n\n  listen 80;\n  server_name zulip.domain.tld;\n  return 301 https://zulip.domain.tld$request_uri;\n\n\n}\n\nserver {\n\n    listen 443;\n    server_name zulip.domain.tld;\n\n    # SSL configuration\n    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/zulip.domain.tld-0001/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/zulip.domain.tld-0001/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot\n    ssl on;\n    ssl_session_cache  builtin:1000  shared:SSL:10m;\n    ssl_protocols  TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;\n    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!CAMELLIA:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;\n    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;\n\n    # Set the access log location\n\n    access_log            /var/log/nginx/zulip.access.log;\n    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;\n\n\n    location / {\n\n    # Set the proxy headers\n\n      proxy_set_header        Host $host;\n      proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n      proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n      proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n\n      # Configure which address the request is proxied to\n\n      proxy_pass          http://127.0.0.1:9011;\n      proxy_read_timeout  90;\n      proxy_redirect      http://127.0.0.1:9011 https://zulip.domain.tld;\n\n      # Set the security headers\n\n      add_header Strict-Transport-Security &quot;max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload&quot;; #HSTS\n      add_header X-Frame-Options DENY; #Prevents clickjacking\n      add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff; #Prevents mime sniffing\n      add_header X-XSS-Protection &quot;1; mode=block&quot;; #Prevents cross-site scripting attacks\n      add_header Referrer-Policy &quot;origin&quot;;\n    }\n\n\n}\n</code></pre></div>",
