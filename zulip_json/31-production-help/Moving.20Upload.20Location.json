I have since reconfigured Zulip to use local storage again but changed the location to a new volume. I moved all the files from the old location to the new location and verified permissions. In settings.py, I have set <code>LOCAL_UPLOADS_DIR = \"/storage\"</code> and commented out the S3 lines. I have also restarted Zulip but it appears Zulip is still looking for files in /home/zulip/uploads. I have also checked the nginx config and it is still pointing to /home/zulip/uploads.</p>\n<p>Should I only have to update settings.py with the new storage location or do I need to update the nginx configs too?</p>",
