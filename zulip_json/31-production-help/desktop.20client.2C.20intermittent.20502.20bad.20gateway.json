I tested various scenarios including local setup with just a switch in betwwen server and client. The installation is done over a clean Ubuntu Server 16.04.4 LTS that is current from Ubuntu website. The hypervisor of this VM is Hyper-V 2016 and the VM is created as generation 8 to allow backups.<br/>\nThese intermittent 502 bad gateway are followed imediately by repeated requests on the same URL with status 200 responses and do not pose a big problem. However if the 502 error happens to the /json/presence? request then the whole desktop client (or chrome browser) get only 502 nginx bad gatweay screen. At this stage the server is not broken. Hard refreshing the browser/client does not solve the issue. Closing the browser/client clears the issue and reopening allows proper reconnect to zulip server. It can take anything from 1 hour to 48 hours for the crash to happen.</p>",
