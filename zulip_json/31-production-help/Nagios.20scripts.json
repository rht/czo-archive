I've tried looking at the docs to figure out what purpose these script are being run when I don't have a Nagios agent configured on this host to monitor Zulip. Does it serve some sort of self-monitoring purpose? Can I disable them, as I'm worried about the overall load this system is generating compared to the very low level of user generated activity it's seeing.</p>",
