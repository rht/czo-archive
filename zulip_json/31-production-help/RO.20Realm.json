You might be able to block messages in particular by just making <code>do_send_message</code> do a <code>raise JsonableError(\"Server is read-only\")</code>; but you'd need to be more systematic to prevent adding emoji reactions or other changes. It's not a trivial thing to do -- e.g. a read-only database connection would probably make it impossible to login.</p>",
