However, if they undo their e-mail change, they can access their old account again. Do you have any idea how I can fix this? In the zulip organisation settings, e-mail changes are allowed (<a href=\"https://zulip.com/help/restrict-name-and-email-changes#prevent-all-email-changes\">docs</a>). Or is this an IdP issue? Please consider that the e-mail address is <strong>not</strong> the <code>attr_user_permanent_id</code> in our SAML settings in <code>/etc/zulip/settings.py</code>.<br>\nHelp would be greatly appreciated <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",
