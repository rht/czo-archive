Rerunning the installer should work (it's idempotent) but doing so may will drop your database.  (Depending on what you're trying to do, that may be a good thing).</p>",

I should get a chance to try that command in production soon (in the case discussed above, I ended up re-installing from scratch anyway, because I reimaged the VM, but we've got another transfer-installation coming soon I think).</p>",
