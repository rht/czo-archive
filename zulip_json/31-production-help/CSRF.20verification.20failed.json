If you do nothing else, please remove <code>http://127.0.0.1</code> and <code>http://localhost</code> from <code>CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS</code>.  They are not helping your problem, and are <em>very</em> exploitable configuration.  It does not matter if your Zulip instance is not public -- that configuration makes that moot.</p>\n<p>If you look at <code>/var/log/nginx/access.log</code>, do you see requests always coming from the same IP address?  Do you have the IP address of your proxy set in <code>/etc/zulip/zulip.conf</code>?</p>",
