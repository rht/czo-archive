Is this a way of doing something like this ?</p>\n<p>If we can't, we searched another solution and we found the api.<br>\nWe can't create user via api and I saw by searching her,  we can delete them by api too (it's not in the doc ) by DELETE /users/idUser .<br>\nMy question is can we modify it by api ? Coz sometimes we change username or password of our user in our app and we want to impact the zulip account to. </p>\n<p>If it's not possible we thought about a bot \"API super bot (self-hosted only)\",  but doesn't found a lot of doc about it ... Can he create, update and delete user via the API of our app ? <br>\nBecause I saw this \"Send content to and from another product.\" and this \"Automate tasks a human user could do.\"  so I suppose a bot can connect with our API to get the update of our user and impact the user on the zulip server.</p>\n<p>Do you have any suggestion ?<br>\nThanks a lot for your time.</p>",
