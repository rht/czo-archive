We migrated it to a new droplet only because after years of being such an active community, the database was filling a large fraction of our 60 GB disk. (It was an old droplet, and they've changed their prices/sizes since we originally got it; it was just like the current $40/mo option except a smaller disk.) With 16 GB, the majority of the RAM is used by the kernel for cache, which just helps keep things fast.</p>",
