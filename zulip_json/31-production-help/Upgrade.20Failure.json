Then today i went to upgrade zulip forgetting that it was a zulip git deployment. I did a upgrade to zulip 4.3. Yeah i know. really dumb. I did not make a backup before the upgrade. is there any way i might be able to retrieve my chat/topic data? I tried to roll back to my old deployment but I am now getting database column missing error. Any advice would be great</p>",
