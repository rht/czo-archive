I would like to use Mail-in-a-box as my email server, because I already got one up and running for my organisation. But the <a href=\"mailto:noreply@abc.com\">noreply@abc.com</a> is giving me some headaches. I am getting this error: <code>Sender address rejected: not owned by user zulip@abc.com</code> But I do not know how I can set this up. The main <a href=\"mailto:zulip@abc.com\">zulip@abc.com</a> is no problem, the issue is with the \"noreply@\" I already asked in the MIAB support forum, but maybe there is someone here who has successfully used MIAB with Zulip?</p>",

Based on the <a href=\"https://mailinabox.email/advanced-configuration.html#relay\">documentation</a>, you may be able to change this in Mail-in-a-box by creating a mail-forward alias for <code>noreply</code> that includes the <code>zulip</code> user in its permitted senders field. Or you can change <code>NOREPLY_EMAIL_ADDRESS</code> to match <code>EMAIL_HOST_USER</code> in the Zulip configuration.</p>",
