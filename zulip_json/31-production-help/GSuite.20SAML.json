Zulip stores some data before redirecting to the IdP and sends an associated token in <code>RelayState</code> (that will allow retrieving the data when you come back from the IdP). This error happens if the data isn't found - for example if it expires (that takes 15 minutes though), or if the token is invalid for some reason. Could you check the <code>RelayState</code> that is sent in the redirect to the IdP and the value of it when the IdP sends you back to Zulip?</p>",
