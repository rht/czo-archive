I can't see a setting for \"user-content\" or anything like that, just how to punt them up to S3.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"13059\">@James</span> we don't have an explicit setting for that; the S3 backend should achieve whatever goals one might have from using a separate domain.  I don't think it would be super hard to add a nginx configuration option to serve uploads from a different domain from the same server, but I'd like to understand the use case before spending time on how to do that, since it's not clear to me there is a good one.</p>",
