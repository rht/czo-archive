I do not actually intend to use this feature, but it seems very nice and useful, so I decided to have a go, out of curiosity.</p>\n<p>I used the procedure described at <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/python-zulip-api/tree/master/zulip/integrations/bridge_between_zulips\">https://github.com/zulip/python-zulip-api/tree/master/zulip/integrations/bridge_between_zulips</a> to setup two bots.</p>\n<p>I then searched for the <code>run-interrealm-bridge</code> script and found it in the <code>/srv/zulip-venv-cache/</code> tree (found two actuall). When I attempted to run it, I got the following error:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>line 7, in &lt;module&gt;\n    import zulip\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named &#39;zulip&#39;\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Is there an easy way I could fix this? As mentioned, this is just a test and is not important per se.</p>",

But I think if you did <code>source /srv/zulip-py3-venv/bin/activate</code> to enter the virtualenv before running the bridge software, that should work too.</p>",
