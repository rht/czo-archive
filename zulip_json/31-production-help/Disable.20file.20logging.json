I don't want to have to manually rotate those files and logging to console makes it logged in SMF (i'm running on SmartOS / Solaris) anyway. I've added:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>DEFAULT_ZULIP_HANDLERS = (\n    [&#39;zulip_admins&#39;, &#39;console&#39;]\n)\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>to my <code>/etc/zulip/settings.py</code> but that doesn't seem to make difference.  I think thats because those changes are overridden by <code>/home/zulip/zproject/settings.py</code> Any thoughts?</p>",

As far as I can tell the other logs a quite low traffic. So pretty low risk for. However personally I wouldn't mind if they are all disabled. </p>\n<p>I think the \"nicest\" solution would be if those logs could somehow be send to a logging backend like Graylog or an ELK stack. Mayabe via the GELF protocol. As far as I can tell that should be pretty simple: <a href=\"https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2013/09/18/central-logging-django-graylog2-and-graypy/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2013/09/18/central-logging-django-graylog2-and-graypy/\">https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2013/09/18/central-logging-django-graylog2-and-graypy/</a> . Is there perhaps a way we could more easily override the logging settings in <code>/etc/zulip/settings.py</code>?</p>",
