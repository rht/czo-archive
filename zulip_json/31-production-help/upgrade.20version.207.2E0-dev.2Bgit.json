As Zulip cloud always runs the most recent dev server version (currently version 7.0-dev+git with server 6.1), and we installed the same, I was wondering how I upgrade my local instance in the future. I am gladly keeping the dev version, testing new features sooner. Where to find the right tarballs? </p>\n<p>These commands would throw me back in version history as far as I understand<br>\n<code>curl -fLO https://download.zulip.com/server/zulip-server-latest.tar.gz</code><br>\n<code>/home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/upgrade-zulip zulip-server-latest.tar.gz</code></p>\n<p>Had a look <a href=\"https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade.html#upgrading-from-a-git-repository\">here</a> and suppose it should be something like: </p>\n<p><code>/home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/upgrade-zulip-from-git 7.1-dev</code> when released?</p>",
