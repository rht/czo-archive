After that they are full members. You can configure how long the waiting period is, as well as which actions require being a full member.</p>\n<p>Currently, the following actions support limiting access to full members.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>Creating streams\nAdding users to streams\nRestricting posting to a stream\n</code></pre></div>\n\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think what you're referring to as \"member\" is probably roughly what that page calls \"new member\" (or perhaps \"member\" = \"new member\"+\"full member\"). So, \"duration of membership\" or \"permissions, depending on realm configuration\", depending on whether you mean \"what controls which category somebody falls into\" or \"what is the impact of the category\"</p>",
