I don't think we've done any work that would enable that, though -- IIRC that means that the Zulip server needs to be joined to the domain, which is something that we can't do for Zulip Cloud.  It's potentially doable with self-hosted Zulip, but IIRC recalls some finagling to get the server joined to AD.  But the last time I tried this was over a decade ago, so it may have gotten better.</p>",
