We've run into an interesting app ecosystem problem to solve and are exploring the edges of the problem: To date the IETF datatracker (our oidc provider) has been very liberal with what people can enter for a Name. When we do oidc login to our instance of Zulip, we use Name as the username. Unfortunately we have some small number of 100s of users that have set their Name to be their email address and Zulip rejects the name because of the @.<br>\nI'm wondering if Zulip _needs_ to reject the @. I can explore either forced data cleanup (making people change their names) or tranforming the names presented under oidc, of course, but I wanted to get a feel for how hard this constraint is at Zulip.</p>",
