In general Zulip instances need to be at publicly resolvable  URLs, see <a href=\"https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/install.html#step-2-install-zulip\">the Install Guide</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>--hostname=zulip.example.com</code>: The user-accessible domain name for this Zulip server, i.e., what users will type in their web browser. This becomes EXTERNAL_HOST (docs) in the Zulip settings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And so you might be looking for something like <code>--hostname=zulip.zac.example.com</code> or whatever your public domain is. With that, I'm off for the evening and weekend</p>",
