I was not online .<br>\nBasically , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-email=\"dxsun@mit.edu\">@Daniel Sun</span> there are two ways to solve that issue :<br>\n1. <code>sudo apt-get install dos2unix</code> to install <code>dos2unix</code> and then convert the file by <code>dos2unix scripts/lib/setup-apt-repo</code> . The proper conversion will give you a prompt of conversion done successfully and then the bad interpertor error won't be troubling you anymore.(remember this everytime you face windows line endings error).<br>\n2. If you use vim and have a basic idea about it then <code>:set ff=unix</code> will get the file to unix format and then you need to successfully save the file. You can make this default by   setting up a <code>:set ff=unix</code> line n your .vimrc file if you happen to use vim regularly . Hope this helps. Kindly let us know !</p>",
