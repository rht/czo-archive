We have already integrated ldap authentication a few months ago and for whatever reason he was still logged in with the local account and so we didnt notice until now.<br>\nNow we want to \"migrate\" this user to the ldap user so that the ldap user has all the chats and so on from the local user.<br>\nI already tried changing the ids and uuids in the zulip database (with testusers) but that didnt work well.<br>\nIs there an easier way of doing this in zulip or even a way to export all chats of a user and import them on another.<br>\nThanks in advance.</p>",
