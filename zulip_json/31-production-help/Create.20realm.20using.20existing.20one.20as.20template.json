I see that when I use the <code>generate_realm_creation_link</code> flow I can base the new organisation off an old one, but when using the <code>create_realm</code> management command it just uses the default settings.</p>\n<p>Is there some way to copy the settings when using <code>create_realm</code> ? If not, would the best way to copy the settings between realms to use something like this code: <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/159449b448808ebf80caa922aaca18e58cf2741c/zerver/actions/create_realm.py#L82\">https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/159449b448808ebf80caa922aaca18e58cf2741c/zerver/actions/create_realm.py#L82</a></p>",
