I'm running a server which is on version <code>ZULIP_VERSION: 3.0-1012-g4917391133</code>, and sometimes get error messages when users try to post something. I want to see if updating from git helps, but I don't want to update past the branch point of the next stable release, as I want to use that eventually.</p>",
