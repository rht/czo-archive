I tried to apply the same pattern to other characters that would be URL-encoded to a %form and passed <code>stream=stream%2Fname</code> (for <code>stream/name</code>). However, the Zulip Notification Bot contacted me when triggering the test notification on New Relic, telling me that the stream <code>#stream%2Fname</code> does not exist. So maybe this has changed and now with the new New Relic web hooks URL-encoding is no longer necessary?</p>\n<p>And a question / request: <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"17808\">@Max Zawisa</span>, did you notice anything when testing \"acknowledged\" or \"closed\" events, is information about the person triggering the event included in the payload?
