For installing Zulip on the same server hence we are considering using Zulip-Docker for that case. However since zulip-docker is not as good as the main zulip install, I was wondering whether it is possible to install the main zulip in kind of a sub-folder (environment) way. Such that I could install in a folder/environment like <code>Zulip</code> and it treats that as root.</p>",
