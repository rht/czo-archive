I am not sure if this is the right place to ask for installation help, so please direct me if so.<br>\nI have successfully installed Zulip on my local machine following <a href=\"https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev-env-first-time-contributors.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev-env-first-time-contributors.html\">this</a> guide. However, when I try to do so over SSH on a remote VPS server, I consistently get an error. I spent like 5 hours googling and trying to solve it, but I have not succeeded yet. So maybe you could direct me to the solution?</p>\n<p>On the remote I have Ubuntu 14.04 and I have run <code>sudo apt-get update</code>.<br>\nI have completed all the previous steps, but on <code>vagrant up</code> step, I am getting:<br>\n<code>There was an error executing [\"sudo\", \"/usr/local/bin/vagrant-lxc-wrapper\", \"lxc-start\", \"-d\", \"--name\", \"zulip_default_1489850011287_47815\"]</code></p>",
