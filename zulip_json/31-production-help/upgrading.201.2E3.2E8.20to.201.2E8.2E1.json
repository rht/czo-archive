However, looking at the documentation for upgrading, it looks like it isn't going to be easy. If I understand it correctly, the export/import tools won't do me any good as I have to import  to the same version of Zulip. Upgrading the existing server seems likely to be very painful as there are database changes, and I guess I'd have to modify the schema and just keep trying til it worked. Are there any other options I have? Are the database changes likely to happen in future releases (meaning this would have to be done again)?</p>",

The upgrade command takes care of the database changes automatically.</p>\n<p>(And you're correct that export/import won't work here.)</p>",

I'll try that tomorrow -- thanks for the advice.</p>",
