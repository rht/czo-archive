Click here to create it.</p>\n<p>My question is that how we can resolve this issue. <br>\nDo we need to recreate a new stream name without using Unicode? <br>\nOr do we need to do something differently to make github to accept our stream name ùù∫ Clojure?</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for taking your time to read my message. </p>\n<p>John</p>",
