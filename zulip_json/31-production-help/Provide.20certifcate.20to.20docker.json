As my zulip is behind a nginx reverse proxy that handles https for me i should not need to do it, but proxy to http ends in \"to many redirects\", so i deceided to provide my already exsisitng cert to the image and try to proxy to https as the docu did say. But the docu on github does not clear spezify what the value for SSL_CERTIFICATE_GENERATION should be in this case and how to tell zulip the correct cert. Can some one help please?</p>",
