        "content": "<p>Hello,</p>\n<p>So I set up a fresh Debian install and downloaded Zulip. I saw in the user guides that the regular install script was the recommended set-up, so I started there. Unfortunately, when I run the script, I immediately get \"Error code 1.\" Even more unfortunately,  /var/log/zulip/install.log contains no further details. Instead it contains a re-print of the script help file. Would someone be able to point me in the right direction? One question I have is, do I need to have the Apache server up and running prior to installing Zulip? Or does the Zulip script set that up for me? Thank you very much!</p>",
