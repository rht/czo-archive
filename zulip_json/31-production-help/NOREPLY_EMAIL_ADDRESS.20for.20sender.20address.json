I thought I could use the NOREPLY_EMAIL_ADDRESS to set that, but it seems like Zulip is using a randomly generated reply address, for example: 'noreply-7voxcq9t7truud3j8mm4kxz4@EXTERNAL_HOST'. when it sends. Is there a way to get it to use the NOREPLY_EMAIL_ADDRESS for sending the mail?</p>\n<p>It seems like the from address is used in django/core/mail/backends/smtp.py line 127:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>    def _send(self, email_message):\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;A helper method that does the actual sending.&quot;&quot;&quot;\n        if not email_message.recipients():\n            return False\n        encoding = email_message.encoding or settings.DEFAULT_CHARSET\n        from_email = sanitize_address(email_message.from_email, encoding)\n        recipients = [sanitize_address(addr, encoding) for addr in email_message.recipients()]\n        message = email_message.message()\n        try:\n            self.connection.sendmail(from_email, recipients, message.as_bytes(linesep=&#39;\\r\\n&#39;))\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>I don't know where email_message.from_email comes from, but it seems to be randomly generated.</p>",
