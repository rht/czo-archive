After what I believe was a successful import of a backup from another server into this new Ubuntu 18.04 server, I changed DNS for my domain and then tried to add a Let's Encrypt certificate using <code>/home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/setup/setup-certbot --email=EMAIL HOSTNAME [HOSTNAME2...]</code>. This results in instant completion, with only this output:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>+ CERTBOT_PATH=/usr/local/sbin/certbot-auto\n+ wget -q https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto -O /usr/local/sbin/certbot-auto\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>and nothing else happens.
