In my use case there are messages from users that dont exist in the rocketchat database anymore and as far as i can tell this collides in multiple areas during the import as the script tries to look up the id/name of the user corresponding to the message, but cannot find the user as they dont exist in the user dict.</p>\n</blockquote>",
