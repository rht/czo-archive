I am working on such a list of generic errors that we might be able to quote in our documentation or some other place so that people with windows OS can also start contributing without much problem of provisioning. This amendment of documentation can be  considered to be temporary in the situation that once our provisioning runs successfully we remove away these amendments. Also, this would help all the developers focus on other bugs rather than basic provisioning bugs. This is what I wanted to propose ! </p>",
