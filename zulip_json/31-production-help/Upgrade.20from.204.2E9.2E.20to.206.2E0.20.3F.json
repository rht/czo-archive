Zulip uses the former; however, in installing it to do that, we also get the <code>puppet</code> system service, which tries to do the latter.  By default, it assumes that your central Puppet server is named <code>puppet</code> -- that's what it's trying and failing to look up in that warning.</p>\n<p>This warning is harmless.  It's not related to netplan, as far I would guess.</p>\n<p>Regardless, we potentially should disable the <code>puppet</code> service so it doesn't try and fail to reach a <code>puppet</code> server repeatedly.  Ironically, we'd probably do this within our puppet configuration.</p>",
