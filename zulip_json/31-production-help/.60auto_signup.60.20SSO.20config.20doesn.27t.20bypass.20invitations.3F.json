It supports PATCH updates, but doesn't require them. The issue I'm seeing here is something different though. An update request in SCIM can be  PATCH or PUT.  But your request is a <code>POST</code> and in SCIM that's a \"create\" operation. So I believe that authentik is trying to create this user and doesn't understand that the user is supposed to already exist on the server and just be updated. I don't know what are the options to make authentik behave correctly here, since I didn't find any more docs as mentioned - but the way that Okta does it by default is that it first checks via a GET SCIM request whether the user already exists to know if it should be creating (POST) or updating (PUT).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/scim/scim-20/#create-users\">https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/scim/scim-20/#create-users</a>:<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/c0/RcLJrJjR09_mC500dMtGPVJI/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/c0/RcLJrJjR09_mC500dMtGPVJI/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/c0/RcLJrJjR09_mC500dMtGPVJI/image.png\"></a></div>",

I imagine I can modify this in the authentik database to have them marked as existing, as contrarily there is no interface to do so.
