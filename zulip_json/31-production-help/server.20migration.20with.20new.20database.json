As I have created a PostgreSQL Cluster, I am planning to move the local DB to the newly created cluster, however, I need to clarify a few things and see if what I am doing is correct:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create new database on cluster</li>\n<li>connect new Zulip VM to Posgresql</li>\n<li>export Zulip using export tools</li>\n<li>import tar.gz file</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Is this the right way to do it?</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>",
