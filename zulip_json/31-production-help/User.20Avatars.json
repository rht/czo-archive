Going through the code it looks like it can be done easily by iterating through all the userprofiles which have <a href=\"http://domain.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://domain.com\">domain.com</a> domain, reading the file from disk and setting the avatar by calling the 2 apparopriate functions. Can you wait for a couple of hours till <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"7\">@Tim Abbott</span> comes online? It's not common to use custom scripts for doing things in Zulip to avoid any unwanted side effects. I just want to make sure that this is the right thing to do.</p>",
