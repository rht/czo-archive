The docs are a bit thin in this regard, <code>AUTH_LDAP_REQUIRE_GROUP</code> is documented but not much else. How are things synced? Does the system used the SID, the UUID or the group name? How does it track changes in group names or memberships? Would the nightly cronjob pick up group changes? What happens to groups that were deleted on the LDAP side?</p>",
