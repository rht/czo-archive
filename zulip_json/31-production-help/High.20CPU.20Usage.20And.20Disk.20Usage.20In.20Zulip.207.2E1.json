(In fact, there are very few streams on the server at this time, and there is not much content in the streams.) During this time, I am even unable to connect to my server via SSH. I would like to know if there is a problem with my hardware configuration or if it could be caused by other issues?</p>\n<p>Here are some configurations of my server and monitoring charts of its performance after clicking data export:<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/2c/pfEIu_wPdMfZPjclLlgdUeNN/image.png\">image.png</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/7a/WKmgfuxV94c6aCfxeXkKWfjQ/image.png\">image.png</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/91/IuDFKStjYTjmODJPmRu2iEvK/image.png\">image.png</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/70/4EfhLDYcRlxcEK1Lqkk7xuHs/image.png\">image.png</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/9a/ChJbZEFf2G9PRm8QhBNgdQvv/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/2c/pfEIu_wPdMfZPjclLlgdUeNN/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/2c/pfEIu_wPdMfZPjclLlgdUeNN/image.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/7a/WKmgfuxV94c6aCfxeXkKWfjQ/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/7a/WKmgfuxV94c6aCfxeXkKWfjQ/image.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/91/IuDFKStjYTjmODJPmRu2iEvK/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/91/IuDFKStjYTjmODJPmRu2iEvK/image.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/70/4EfhLDYcRlxcEK1Lqkk7xuHs/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/70/4EfhLDYcRlxcEK1Lqkk7xuHs/image.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/9a/ChJbZEFf2G9PRm8QhBNgdQvv/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/9a/ChJbZEFf2G9PRm8QhBNgdQvv/image.png\"></a></div>",

I expect the  story is that 4GB of RAM is sufficient for running the Zulip server on all versions, but apparently not sufficient to run the Zulip server as well as the export tool at the same time starting with 7.0.</p>\n<p>I think there's a good chance that 8.0 will consume less memory than 7.0, since I think there's at least one queue worker process that we'll be removing; in the meantime, you can probably use 7.x with 4GB of RAM if you just make your backups cron job stop the Zulip server and then restart it once the export is complete.</p>\n<p>(Or just do like 5GB of RAM)</p>",
