So I think you'll have to add some configuraiton to allow remote authentication with password - this could be useful - <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/auth-pg-hba-conf.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/auth-pg-hba-conf.html\">https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/auth-pg-hba-conf.html</a></p>\n<p>And to set a password for the zulip user in postgres, you can <code>su</code> to the <code>zulip</code> user on the server and connect using peer auth <code>psql -U zulip</code> and do whatever you need in the shell that way.</p>",
