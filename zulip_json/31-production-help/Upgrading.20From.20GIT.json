        "content": "<p>Hi, I have a production install on Ubuntu 18.04, running 4GB memory on 4 cores (VPS).  I have WSL2 set up on WIn 10.  I forked the Zulip main into briansmith337/zulip.  I checked that out on to my development environment, and following the Zulip \"Making Changes\" documentation, I did  a checkout and created a new branch (defend) then pushed back - git push origin +defend.  I had to run an add -a, commit, etc - but everything worked and I'm fully synched with my repositorie(s) on git.  I have the exact same version on my production server, and updated my git_repo_url, then ran the command \"/home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/upgrade-zulip-from-git defend\".  It gave me a failure - so I completely uninstalled my production server, rebuilt the OS, and reinstalled per the Zulip docs.  Went through the process again, and received the same error.  It keeps dying on + ./tools/webpack.   (Image Provided) - Any help would be greatly appreciated! <a href=\"/user_uploads/2/8f/j9GDM0JLsMT9MuppVe2YY2kF/Capture.PNG\" title=\"Capture.PNG\">Capture.PNG</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/8f/j9GDM0JLsMT9MuppVe2YY2kF/Capture.PNG\" title=\"Capture.PNG\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/8f/j9GDM0JLsMT9MuppVe2YY2kF/Capture.PNG\"></a></div>",
