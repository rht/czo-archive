I am a bit skeptical that adding a feature to do so would solve your problem; it seems likely those users will reply to whatever the most recent topic is, and you can fix that by moving the messages to an appropriate topic, and it likely will be the same cleanup/teaching effort whether a \"stream events\" topic exists or not? </p>\n<p>Maybe I'm missing something here, feel free to add more context on what you're doing.</p>",
