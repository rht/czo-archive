Really appreciate. <br>\nSo how will I able to mount log file path to volumes on docker-compose.yml file?<br>\nI don't see to find any example online.<br>\nAlso, I am thinking to let zulip connect to our own authentication system here. Is that possible?<br>\nIf it does, is there any documents on this configuration?<br>\nThank you so much for your help again. :)</p>",

If I don't want to set Maunal_configuration: true. I will have to add extra lines to docker-compose.yml file.<br>\nSo how about set log files path to volumes. I don't seem to find any examples online.<br>\nDo you know where I can find those information?<br>\nThank you. :)</p>",
