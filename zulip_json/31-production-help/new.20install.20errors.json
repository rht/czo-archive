I tried installing several times. First time around I had errors with nginx, so I deleted my old configfile and reran the installation of zulip. The nginx error dissapeard but instead the database 'zulip' was not found. I reran, without doing anything, now the database seems to exist but not the mentioned relation. i reran several times since then with no further change, even removing postgresql from the vps for a fresh start on that. </p>\n<p>install.log appended</p>\n<p>thanks for any input! <a href=\"/user_uploads/2/59/vSP3YZIqG_bXR1p3t8F7d9TH/install.txt\">install.txt</a></p>\n<p>(sorry for keeping you waiting, I had trouble getting scp to work and had to copy from the terminal, so you only get the latest attempts log...)</p>",
