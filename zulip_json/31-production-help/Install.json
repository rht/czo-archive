We strongly recommend using either a fresh machine instance in a cloud provider, a fresh VM, <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/docker-zulip#readme\">our Docker image</a>, or a dedicated machine. If you decide to disregard our advice and use a server that hosts other services, we can’t support you, but <a href=\"https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/install-existing-server.html\">we do have some notes on issues you’ll encounter</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>",
