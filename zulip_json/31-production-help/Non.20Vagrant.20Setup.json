So I think we have two follow-up items you can work on as first contributions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check permissions on the Zulip directory are world-readable early in <code>postgres-init-dev-db</code>, and give a nice error message explaining the problem you had to work around</li>\n<li>Make <code>manage.py</code> in development check if <code>var/log</code> exists, and if not, create it, to try to eliminate that second problem.</li>\n</ul>",
