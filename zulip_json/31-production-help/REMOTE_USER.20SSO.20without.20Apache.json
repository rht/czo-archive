There's a proxy that sets a header with our SSO details before hitting Zulip at all, so I shouldn't need the apache_sso puppet. I'm setting the <code>request.META[\"REMOTE_USER\"]</code> via a <code>uwsgi_param</code> directive. The odd thing is that it keeps redirecting me back to <code>/accounts/login/sso</code> even on success. Does anyone have a few minutes to troubleshoot? Maybe <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"7\">@Tim Abbott</span> ?</p>",
