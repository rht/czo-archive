The documentation recommends mailgun and sendgrid and states that those have free options, but as far as i can see, mailgun only has a free plan for one month, and sendgrid's free plan only gives 100 mails per day which can be limiting, if people use email notifications.</p>\n<p>Does anybody have a better recommendation for a free email service?</p>",
