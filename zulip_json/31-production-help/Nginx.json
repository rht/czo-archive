But I am installing on a vps and I would like to use the same server to install zulip  + redmine (that uses nginx).<br>\nFrom what I understand, zulip installs nginx with zulip user, but I might have to change it to www-data user ? but this will probably break all the database/scripts related to a user with \"zulip\". Is it possible to change the scripts to use www-data user instead of zulip user?</p>",
