(e.g. \"Full Name\")</li>\n<li>I specify <code>extra_args</code> as an array of the attributes I'd like to use for my custom profile fields.</li>\n<li>I fill <code>SOCIAL_AUTH_SYNC_CUSTOM_ATTRS_DICT</code> with mappings of the names of the custom profile fields to the SAML-attributes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But how am I supposed to specify the SAML-attributes in part 2. and 3.? Can I specify them as <code>urn:oid:[...]</code> ids?<br>\nAnd will the users be able to change the content of the custom profile fields? (That wouldn't be good...)</p>",

Though the \"expected\" way to do it is to configure it just like the <code>attr_email</code>, <code>attr_first_name</code> etc. - so mapping them to the attribute name, as configured on the IdP side.</p>",
