I know it is discouraged, but I have made backups, so I don't mess up and want to try anyway.<br>\nI have apache2 already running with 3 subdomains, but as I read, Zulip uses nginx. Normally it shouldn't be a problem to port the nginx config to apache? Even if I let nginx run on port 81 for example, I should be able to reroute it.<br>\nThis wouldn't even be my main concern. I know I tried to do this like 2 weeks ago but gave up. I am now revisiting this, as no other app meets my requirements. I remember that an issue occured, because I already have a Postgres running. How could I use my existing Postgres database?<br>\nI would really appreciate any help, as Zulip is the only application meeting my requirements!</p>",
