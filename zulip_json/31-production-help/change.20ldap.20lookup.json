The AUTH_LDAP_USER_SEARCH is configured to use a lookup of <code>\"(mail=%(user)s)\"</code> and that works fine allowing users to login with their email address. However in most of our internal applications users login with a userid, not an email address. </p>\n<p>So I want to change my zulip install to have a look up filter of <code>\"(uid=%(user)s)\"</code>. When I did this and tested with <code>mange.py query_ldap &lt;username&gt;</code> everything shows up fine. However, when I login to our realm My Zulip user doesn't have the correct presance. </p>\n<p>How can I change our authentication to move from email to username and preserve the existing users?</p>",
