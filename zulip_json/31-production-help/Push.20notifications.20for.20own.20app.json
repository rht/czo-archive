Here are a couple of questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>What does the \"FCM push notifications key in the Google Developer console\" mentioned in <a href=\"https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/mobile-push-notifications.html#sending-push-notifications-directly-from-your-server\">#sending-push-notifications-directly-from-your-server</a> refer to? Is it the <code>current_key</code> found in google-services.json? The key is meant to be stored as a string in /etc/zulip/zulip-secrets.conf (as <code>android_gcm_api_key</code>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Does the firebase.xml file need to be updated to reflect the clone's data?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Are there other parameters to modify?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",
