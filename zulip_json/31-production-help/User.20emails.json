Is possible to make users without email addresses? I tried via manage.py, but it asks for an email.</p>",

I suppose my concern with that is, if we let people go, then they still have an inroad to the business. I guess this worry is not really realistic, since I can simply remove them as users from Zulip, right?</p>",
