I've got TLS, certificates, port forwarding, and all that under control. It's running behind a reverse proxy Apache2 server on the same server hardware so that I can have Zulip running at a subdomain and something else running on the main domain, if that's relevant.</p>\n<p>What might further be relevant is that this is a server I'm running for a small community of friends, so it's not like this is particularly pressing right now.
