If you stop and start your server (which you may be forced to do if it has hardware problems), you may get a different host and thus a different hostname.</p>\n<p>To use your server, you're going to need to give it <em>another</em> name other than the one that AWS has for it.  That's generally done by buying a domain name (like <code>example.com</code>), and registering a host in that domain (like <code>zulip.example.com</code>) which points to the same server.  By \"points to\" most folks use what's called a CNAME record, which is how DNS says \"this name (<code>zulip.example.com</code>) is an alias for <code>ec2-65-0-011-123.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com</code>)\" and browsers will know to find who <a href=\"http://zulip.example.com\">zulip.example.com</a> is based on that.</p>\n<p>When you set up Zulip, you should use the friendly name you made (<code>zulip.example.com</code>).  This is because that's what users will be typing into their browsers, and that's how SSL will know they have the right host (this is a simplification).  In the case that you need to turn your host off and back on again, and AWS gives you a different computer, you can change the CNAME to point to the new host they gave you -- and your users will be none the wiser, since they will continue to use <code>zulip.example.com</code></p>",
