Setting up a server takes just a couple of minutes. Zulip runs on Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic, Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial, Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty, and Debian 9 Stretch. The installation process is documented here. Commercial support is available; see https://zulipchat.com/plans for details.\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>However, if you attempt to use the installation script on a base Debian install, you are told this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>+++ dirname ./zulip-server-1.8.1/scripts/lib/install\n++ readlink -f ./zulip-server-1.8.1/scripts/lib/../..\n+ ZULIP_PATH=/tmp/tmp.w5q46QB9qb/zulip-server-1.8.1\n+ export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\n+ LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\n+ apt-get install -y lsb-release\nReading package lists...\nBuilding dependency tree...\nReading state information...\nlsb-release is already the newest version (9.20161125).\n0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.\n++ lsb_release -sc\n+ os_release=stretch\n+ case &quot;$os_release&quot; in\n+ set +x\n\nUnsupported OS release: stretch\n\nZulip in production is supported only on:\n - Ubuntu 14.04 LTS &quot;trusty&quot;\n - Ubuntu 16.04 LTS &quot;xenial&quot;\n\nFor more information, see:\n  https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/requirements.html\n\nZulip installation failed!\n\nThe install process is designed to be idempotent, so you can retry after resolving whatever issue caused the failure (there should be a traceback above). A log of this installation is available in /var/log/zulip/install.log\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>I can change the OS detection to just work, but I'm wondering if this needs to either be updated in the README, or fixed in the script.</p>",
