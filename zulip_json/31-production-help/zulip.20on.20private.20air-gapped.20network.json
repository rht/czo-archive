Zulip, Mattermost and Rocket are the top contenders.  The one issue I have with your product is the SSL requirement.  Since we run an air-gapped network, there is no need for any special SSL certificates.  is there a way to turn it off so Zulip doesn't require it?</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>",

You'll run into a few other minor problems installing some of our <code>pip</code> dependencies, then, since we install those over the network.

This is for updates and installs only.  Now, the network that has internet access is entirely different the the one that doesn't.  Two different IP addressing schemes.  I can temporarily switch the VM networks.  Once the updates are done, I move it back.</p>\n<p>I have zulip installed and operational.</p>\n<p>Sorry for any mis-representation or confusion.</p>\n<p>I have a few questions about the REST api.  which is the topic for that?  I'm not having any luck finding it.</p>\n<p>I also have questions about how to change the appearance of the UI's.  Specifically, I want to put some local logo's on it.  Same thing, which topic?
