It seems odd for the feed to bounce back and forth between two different discussions, showing each reply under a comment from an unrelated thread.  </p>\n<p>There's also an arbitrarily large region of empty space between the input box and the comments (and the adjacent comment is not even from the thread that I am replying to).  Other chat apps generally keep related comments together.  So I was wondering about the rationale behind this design.</p>",
