Many users for example open help pages in <a href=\"http://zulip.com/help\">zulip.com/help</a> instead of going for <a href=\"http://subdomain.zulip.com/help\">subdomain.zulip.com/help</a>. So we should have an option to toggle which defaults to the value of the user preference I think if there is an organization present.</p>",
