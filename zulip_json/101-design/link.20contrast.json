If we make the background brighter then the contrast between normal text and background will decrease. But if we make the background slightly darker and the link's color a bit brighter, it will improve the current situation.<br>\nI suggest: <br>\nFor Link - #26B8FF<br>\nFor Background - #34404A<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/7d/eX1qVr9IwnKfPj9TmebtG5MP/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/7d/eX1qVr9IwnKfPj9TmebtG5MP/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/7d/eX1qVr9IwnKfPj9TmebtG5MP/image.png\"></a></div>",
