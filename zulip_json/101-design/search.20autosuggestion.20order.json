I think my point of view is that with the current search bar as it is, I would prefer the addition of a search area for PMs that would allow to prioritize users/conversations, while leaving the general search prioritizing sent-by. That is, adding a search area for PMs like we do with streams/topics/users.</p>\n<p>Maybe it would break general design principles here, but if every user has 2 (or more) cases, it almost feels like a multi-column drop-down could be an interesting solution, perhaps even with other non-user matches in separate columns - reverting to nested columns in narrow windows. I think a similar design is used in some modern web designs, though typically with a static drop-down, not for search.</p>",
