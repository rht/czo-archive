This contrasts with, for example, deleting a custom profile field or reordering them, which shows our standard saving...saved organization settings experience. I propose the following changes from testing this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We add a <code>success_continuation</code> when closing these modals after a successful change to show the \"Saved!\" notice on the main settings page, for consistency. </li>\n<li>We change the \"delete a custom profile field\" button to have a confirmation modal showing how many users have set that field, just like we added recently for removing an option for the select field type, rather than just immediately executing the deletion.</li>\n<li>I noticed the modal to confirm deleting an option from a select type custom profile field doesn't tell you which option(s) you removed; maybe it could be extended to address that?</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Interesting work, should I open issues for this first or just start working on PRs?</p>",
