You can look at the icon and send buttons as examples.</p>\n<p>I would maybe focus on color changes first, since they're generally less risky than margin/width stuff.  Color changes can be very high impact for not much work.  We do have a night mode, so be aware of that.  We are generally more conservative on widths and margins, since they tend to be sensitive to zooming, browser quirks, etc.</p>",
