Probably the main issue is that on a wide-ish screen, the people icon is removed and the user list is shown by default. If there is an advantage to the narrow chat - and I think that's sort of debatable - it is negated by the list of users on the right. Not really useful to see a list of users unless you are looking for someone.</p>",
