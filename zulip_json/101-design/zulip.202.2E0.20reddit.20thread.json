The idea is fantastic, but it's so freaking confusing when you join, with notifications everywhere and it's hard to actually tell if you are sending a private message to the right person, etc. etc. I really think a UI overhaul needs to happen before you'll get anyone from my company to even think of it. I looked at twist and the UI seemed much better, but my co-workers were already so scared of the topic concept they weren't even willing to try twist.</p>\n</blockquote>",
