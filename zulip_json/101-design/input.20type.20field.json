And find the solution that Firefox do not strip trailing and leading whitespace in email field where chrome do. Firefox do validate email field but it do not remove whitespace, so it's throwing email validation error.<br>\nBut I also find one article about \"Input type email – better don’t use it!\", <a href=\"https://justmarkup.com/log/2015/02/input-type-email-better-dont-use-it/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://justmarkup.com/log/2015/02/input-type-email-better-dont-use-it/\">https://justmarkup.com/log/2015/02/input-type-email-better-dont-use-it/</a><br>\nI am not much aware, that is this feature(mentions in article-&gt; international email) require or not for our project, so posting here.</p>",
