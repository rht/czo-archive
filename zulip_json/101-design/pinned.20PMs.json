A user I was chatting with suggested that it would be useful to pin PMs, and while we have an old issue for this (<a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/10513\">#10513</a>), I think it would be worth discussing this a bit in the context of product changes/planned changes since then.</p>\n<p>In particular, <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/10513\">#10513</a> is currently tagged as a right sidebar issue (and was discussed this way in <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"3\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/3-backend/topic/pinning.20users\">#backend &gt; pinning users</a> ), but at least some of the comments on the issue assume that it would be a <em>left</em> sidebar change.</p>\n<p>Given that we now have PMs section you can pin open, the left sidebar approach makes more sense to me. I think our plans in <strong>Show stream members in right sidebar</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/21285\">#21285</a> would also make a right sidebar change harder to manage.</p>\n<p>What do folks think?</p>",
