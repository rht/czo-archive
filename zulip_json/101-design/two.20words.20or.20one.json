One-word names, like typical stream names, occupy a fat area of namespace, so if you think of topics as likely one word, then that may reinforce a confusion where you think that a new topic means seizing some prime namespace that you'd better not do unless you're really confident. But if you think of topics as typically being several words, then that doesn't fit together with that misunderstanding and you're more likely to shift to the \"email subject line\" analogy and get the idea better.</p>",
