Zulip has chosen to have its own time zone, rather than automatically using what the OS has.  I think the main reason for this is that sometimes you want to change your OS timezone, so that the clock works, but you still want to appear to Zulip people to be in your \"home\" timezone.  My email client is like Zulip--it has its own concept of timezone.  But it detects when the browser is different than it, and it nags me to change it.</p>",
