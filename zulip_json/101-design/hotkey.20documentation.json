One way to do it is just detect whether we're in the desktop app (there's a few ways we can do this from JS or even the Python backend; simplest is checking User-agent for <code>ZulipElectron</code>) and just have a conditional based on that in the template.  Another option would be to have a \"Desktop app only\" section.</p>",
