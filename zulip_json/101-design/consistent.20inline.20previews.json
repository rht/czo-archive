One possible way to help distinguish between attachment links (especially when one after the other on the same line) can be by having different thumbnails / icons for common file types used accordingly before a file's link.</p>\n<p>Technically this could be by setting the <code>:before</code> pseudoelement  of the file link in CSS to the icon according to the file type. </p>\n<p>This would solve the problem of distinguishability and also add a visual clue for the file type.

I could see having an open-in-new-window icon decoration for links with <code>target=\"_blank\"</code>, i.e. ones that open in a new window, but otherwise would keep normal links unmodified.</p>\n<p>I think the idea of doing this for recognized file extensions is pretty reasonable as a design approach, assuming we're OK with the security reality that we're not validating that a <code>foo.png</code> file actually contains a valid image.</p>\n<p>I'm a bit worried about the approach of applying this CSS to \"Any link inside markdown that isn't in a preview object\". I can't think of a case where that approach would be wrong, and I expect any future element where we don't want this behavior to have a class on it that we can use like we do with previews, so maybe it's fine ... but I can't say I'm comfortable with that.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"699\">@Anders Kaseorg</span> can I get your thoughts on this approach?</p>",
