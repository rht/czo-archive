I think adding margins in Zulip would be a tough sell, partly because we strive to keep us as much content on the screen as possible, at least in the stream view.   There may be other ways to make it a little more clear which messages you sent.  If we were to do a UI experiment along these lines, I could see us trying it out in PM views first.</p>",
