(Let's set aside the question of whether to reorder or renane any of the menu options for now.) I'll kick it off with my thoughts on the major (not purely stylistic) changes from the current icons. In current menu order:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Manage streams: Changing this to a hash makes sense to me!</li>\n<li>Personal settings: I'm not sure whether the person icon says \"personal settings\" to me; elsewhere in the app, similar icons refer to (PMs with) other users. This also reminds me that I believe we've had some discussions about pulling out personal settings into an avatar menu, though I'm not finding the issue for it if there is one. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"7\">@Tim Abbott</span> do you have more context?</li>\n<li>Manage organization: I'm also not sure about the house icon for this one, though I have no attachment to the lightning icon. Something that says \"tweak a bunch of knobs\" is more the direction that would feel intuitive for me here.</li>\n<li>Search operators: I'm not sure about using a label icon here. Do we have analogs from other apps?</li>\n<li>About Zulip: Changing Z -&gt; i makes sense to me here.</li>\n<li>Contact support: I like the idea of making the icon channel-independent, as we describe multiple channels (not just email) on the <a href=\"http://zulip.com/help/contact-support\">linked page</a>. The proposed icon makes sense to me; curios to hear what others think.</li>\n<li>Integrations: <span aria-label=\"100\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f4af\" role=\"img\" title=\"100\">:100:</span> on replacing the GitHub icon. (By the way, I'd love for us to fix <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19797\">#19797</a> as well!) I'd be curious for engineers' perspective as to whether the proposal feels intuitive as an integrations icon.</li>\n<li>API documentation: I guess the proposed change is from an API-ish icon to a documentation-ish icon? Seems reasonable to me...</li>\n<li>Plans and pricing: <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"22433\">@Vlad Korobov</span> let's make sure we have a proposal for a <strong>Plans and pricing</strong> icon. (Easy to miss, as only organization owners are shown this option.)</li>\n</ol>",
