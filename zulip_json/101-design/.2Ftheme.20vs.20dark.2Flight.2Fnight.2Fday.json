I've not adjusted any of the typeaheads, the 'undo' framework or tests yet. The idea was not that we would necessarily remove the current commands like <code>/dark</code>, but have more structure to the slash commands and potentially simplify the typeahead - with the prototype one can do <code>/theme dark</code> or <code>/theme day</code>, for example.<br>\nI'm not sure how good the code is, but wanted to post here before looking into this further. I have a WIP commit at <a href=\"https://github.com/neiljp/zulip/commit/765948135e64347ca240b8180aa5468c05741d63\">https://github.com/neiljp/zulip/commit/765948135e64347ca240b8180aa5468c05741d63</a></p>",
