The desktop app is able to hook into OS APIs for whether the user is actually idle; this is one of the main functional advantages of the desktop app over the web app. (Though it mostly helps other users see your presence more accurately).</p>\n<p>I believe the background here is a new Chrome feature (not supported in other major browsers). It comes with a permissions prompt, like \"Can this site send you desktop notifications?\".
