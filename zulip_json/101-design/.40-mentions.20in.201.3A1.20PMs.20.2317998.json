        "content": "<p>Hey! A few months ago, I filed <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/17998\">#17998</a> for putting up a warning banner when someone is about to @-mention the person they are talking to in a 1:1 PM conversation. The idea was to address the annoyance of messages in 1:1 PM threads being highlighted pink in a way that's not at all useful.</p>\n<p>Thinking about it now while reviewing the PR (<a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/20614\">#20614</a>), I wonder if we should do something more/something other than displaying a banner. Since we know that the message highlighting resulting from an @-mention is unlikely to be a good experience, perhaps we should do something about it more directly. Some ideas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Maybe we could never highlight messages with @-mentions in 1:1 PMs? I'm having a hard time imagining a situation where the highlighting would be really desirable.</li>\n<li>Maybe we could always treat @-mentions in 1:1 PMs as silent? This would affect not just highlighting, but also the @-mentions tab and notifications. I'm not a big fan of this option, because it seems unpredictable for users in a more risky way than (1).</li>\n<li>Maybe we could show the banner and also automatically add <code>_</code> syntax when someone @-mentions their conversation partner? One thing I really like about the banner is that it teaches users about the existence of silent mentions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thoughts?</p>",
