I don't have much experience with color palettes and design work of this kind, so I would really appreciate some feedback from folks on what footer background color could work for both our landing pages and our login/register type pages. Ideally, we would have the same background color on both.</p>\n<p>So far the one I tried is the first color that came up when I Googled \"light tan\", as Alya requested that one in the second round of feedback on my PR. The PR has the screenshots but I'll post them here as well so everyone can see:<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/97/Uhn_z_QF6eML9rtstfp5jecx/footer_desktop.png\">footer_desktop.png</a> <a href=\"/user_uploads/2/a/ZoVv304-yR0cq-KTHFoLRjDM/footer_register.png\">footer_register.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/97/Uhn_z_QF6eML9rtstfp5jecx/footer_desktop.png\" title=\"footer_desktop.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/97/Uhn_z_QF6eML9rtstfp5jecx/footer_desktop.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/a/ZoVv304-yR0cq-KTHFoLRjDM/footer_register.png\" title=\"footer_register.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/a/ZoVv304-yR0cq-KTHFoLRjDM/footer_register.png\"></a></div>",
