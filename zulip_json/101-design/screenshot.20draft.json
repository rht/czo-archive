Perhaps one for each of the points you listed in that image. So the first one would be perhaps  narrowing into a topic from the all messages view, I'm not sure I really understand the second point in the image. I feel like reply when you get it could also much better be described via animated GIF. Each of the GIFS could be titled with the feature name -- like  \"Threaded Topics\", \"Group private chats\", \"Emoji Reactions\" etc...</p>",
