The issue is <code>\"Add user to stream\" interface was hard to find</code>.  If you have a short monitor and go to edit a stream, the UI for adding users (i.e. subscribers) is below the fold.  That whole UI is cluttered.  (It has other issues, too, but I don't want to go too far down the rabbit hole.)</p>",

Also as mentioned somewhere, the term Add is not intuitive. Another problem is that the first section of stream settings i.e. the section till before the email address, perfectly fills the  screen and the overlay, causing us to think that there are no more settings, while in fact there are more when scrolled down.</p>\n<p>What I have in mind is:<br>\n1) Move the stream membership section to the top<br>\n2) Rename the \"Add\" button to \"Subscribe\"(maybe?) and place this where the current search bar is<br>\n3) Implement the search functionality like its been implemented everywhere else , using a search icon which toggles the search text. This may require changing the list a little to make it \"go\" with the changes.<br>\nThis is what I feel.</p>",
