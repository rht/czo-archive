I can see that being something potentially useful for providing a link (E.g. for how to report a problem or get support).  Do we think this is a good idea?  </p>\n<p>Are there any security concerns with potentially adding a feature of this form?  It's something that of course is supported with <code>mailto</code> links in email, but I've not thought about this direction for Zulip before.</p>",
