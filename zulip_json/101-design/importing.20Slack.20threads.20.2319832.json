We have an open PR <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19832\">#19832</a> or being smarter about how Slack threads are imported into Zulip, and it would be great  to get it finalized and integrated.</p>\n<p>The current proposal is that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Non-thread messages will be imported into the \"imported from Slack\" topic (same as now).</li>\n<li>Thread messages will be imported into threads named using the UTC timestamp from the first message in the thread, e.g.: <code>2022/03/23 11:46:33</code>. The idea is that hopefully we don't have two threads started in the same channel in the exact same second.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thoughts on this approach? I think if we go with the timestamp naming concept, it would be good to add something to the topic name to indicate where it comes from. E.g. :</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Slack thread started at 2022/03/23 11:46:33</li>\n<li>Slack thread: 2022/03/23 11:46:33</li>\n<li>2022/03/23 11:46:33 (Slack thread)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These don't quite fit in the left sidebar, but maybe that's OK?</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/7/SGPqYXggnUOOJIpg9EMqhMIh/Screen-Shot-2023-02-27-at-11.48.47-AM.png\">Screen-Shot-2023-02-27-at-11.48.47-AM.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/7/SGPqYXggnUOOJIpg9EMqhMIh/Screen-Shot-2023-02-27-at-11.48.47-AM.png\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2023-02-27-at-11.48.47-AM.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/7/SGPqYXggnUOOJIpg9EMqhMIh/Screen-Shot-2023-02-27-at-11.48.47-AM.png\"></a></div>",
