(Collected in various places; see <a href=\"https://www.deque.com/blog/accessible-forms-the-problem-with-placeholders/\">https://www.deque.com/blog/accessible-forms-the-problem-with-placeholders/</a> for some examples.) The most relevant issue here is the (intentional, to denote \"this is a hint\") lower contrast/visibility. In particular, mimicing that style <em>for button text</em> seems very unwise. From some perspectives, this could be a very important button; making its label harder to read would be a problem.</p>\n<p>(Relatedly, in order to match the placeholder style, I'll need to reverse engineer the browser default, I think, and it might shift by browser. We could solve that by making a .placeholder style, I suppose. Note that, if we were to also use that to increase contrast, it would likely defeat the purpose of placeholders in input in the first place.)</p>\n<p>However, all this only coincidentally dovetails with my primary objection. I think that decorating a button to mimic an input (lower contrast text or not) is deceptive UX. I don't think it'll be a magic bullet for onboarding, but even if it were, it still feels like a hack. Either it's a button, and should look and behave like a button, or we should use an actual input field that looks and behaves like an input field --- and, probably, also consider redesigning the compose box to be more compact as to be left open all the time.
