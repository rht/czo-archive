I don't think we should convert all svg icons to a font since we need precise control over size and alignment. I suggest to have icons as js components which would inline svg icons in the dom. If you want to use svg as files and link to those files from the css it's also ok. I guess embedding svg as a string in css or base64 is less preferred since its harder to manage (it does help with initial speed of loading)</p>",
