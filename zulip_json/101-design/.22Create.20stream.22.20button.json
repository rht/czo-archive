The other buttons that look like the current version (\"All streams\" and \"A-&gt;Z\" in the screenoshot) are indicating that a particular view is currently selected, which isn't really the semantics that <code>+</code> has.</p>\n<p>The unselected button look might be more neutral? We could also play with making the <code>+</code> itself a different color; not sure if it would be too much.</p>",
