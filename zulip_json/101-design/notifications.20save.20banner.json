One thing to keep in mind is that we have a few settings that require reloading the browser after changes (because they're rarely changed); we should make sure we still have a way to express that idea.  And for admin settings where we want someone to click \"save\", we could use the space to show \"Unsaved changed\" in red, so the user knows we're not auto-saving in that widget.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-email=\"brock@zulipchat.com\" data-user-id=\"136\">@Brock Whittaker</span> FYI since we've been talking about cleaning up the alerts system.</p>",
