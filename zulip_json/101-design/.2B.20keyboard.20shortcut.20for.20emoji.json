I was pondering the possibility that we could advertise it in the tooltip when you're hovering over the first emoji reaction in the currently selected message -- i.e. in the scenario where hitting <code>=</code> at that time would do the same thing as clicking.</p>\n<p>Thoughts? It seems in principle helpful but I'm not at all convinced that it would look good with our current design for the reactions hover tooltip to just put a keyboard shortcut hint at the end, since the tooltip is just \"{name} reacted with <span aria-label=\"heart\" class=\"emoji emoji-2764\" role=\"img\" title=\"heart\">:heart:</span>\", with no reference to the click action.</p>",
