When it comes to the dark theme, I do feel that they could benefit from a bit more contrast, but they still catch the eye when hovered over.</p>\n<p>I also wanted to express my appreciation for how we tackled the silent/non-silent mentions. It's truly a step in the right direction, especially considering that in the previous revision, I found myself examining the message source to determine the type of mention. I'm not sure if this was the optimal solution for this, but I think this is the route that most people will take.</p>\n<p>On a personal note, I initially found it challenging to distinguish between silent and non-silent mentions. However, after spending some time with the feature, I've got to it and it's logic. I wonder if we've explored other possible solutions, such as prefixing with an intuitive icon, like a mute symbol, to represent silent mentions? Overall, I believe that placing something more intuitive to convey the concept of silence could potentially enhance the user experience.</p>",
