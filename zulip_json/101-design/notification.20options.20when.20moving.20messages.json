Many topic moves are due to an accidental post to the wrong place, in which case notifications to the old topic are just a distraction. But a notification to the new topic can be helpful for anyone who's seen the messages before to figure out what's going on. We have an issue for changing to this default (<strong>Turn off \"Send notification to old topic\" option by default</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/21838\">#21838</a>).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are also situations when you'd prefer no notifications, e.g. if you fix a typo or make some other quick change to a topic you recently started, where you'd generally prefer no notification. I'm not sure what exactly is the generalization best rule of thum for this situation -- topic name changes within the same stream? or maybe a moving a topic you started? either one? something else?</p>",
