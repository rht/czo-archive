I wasn't able to do so via the stream search icon. Then I tried the global search box,  but was misled in assuming that I could search only in one stream at a time (the stream name with color next to |:home:&gt; appears as if the search box is \"hardened\" only to search in that particular stream. I clicked at the :home: again, to finally discover that I am able to search by topic from there.</p>\n<p>1) I think <code>|:home:&gt; design| :search: stream:design</code>could be clarified with <code>|:home:&gt; :search: stream:design</code>.<br>\n2) The <code>Search people</code> box in the Users sidebar could be replaced with a search button where it reveals a search box -- this is to be consistent with the streams sidebar.<br>\n3) Option to search by topic, in the expanded stream search box (I'm not sure this is necessary if 1) is implemented)</p>",

I have used the highlight in the sidebar and the URI of each message boxes to know which topic I am located at (in a way that this is a redundant information to 'that'). My heatmap is that I navigate to find a topic by clicking through the sidebars more often than using the global search bar (but default to stream search at almost every case).</p>",
