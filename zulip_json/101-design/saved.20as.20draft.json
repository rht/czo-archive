Or even write short response above the draft, cut the draft, send the short response, and paste the draft back into the composebox so it's re-saved.</p>\n<p>This seems like a very niche feature, which is unlikely to be very generally useful or understandable, and my preference would be to just have it so that one can only have one draft per topic (or, if we think that will seriously annoy power users, add an option to disable auto-loading drafts, which we will possibly want to do anyways).</p>\n</blockquote>",

This was tangentially prompted by <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"101\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/Closing.20compose.20box\">#design &gt; Closing compose box</a>, although it's not really related to the issue there.</p>\n<p>I know a lot of users have had confusion in the past where they thought a message they were writing was lost, when it was actually saved in a draft, and that that was part of the reason for adding a notification in the first place. Then it became a tooltip, but it was still down by the compose bar, so any color contrast issues were lessened because a user's eyes would immediately go down there if the compose box closed unexpectedly, and they'd see the notification. But at the new location in the top left, this works against the user now; their eyes are going to move down toward the compose box, away from the tooltip at the top left.</p>\n<p>Maybe there could be a notification banner above the compose box, in addition to or replacing the existing tooltip? I see that there was <a href=\"#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/saved.20as.20draft/search/banner\">some discussion of banners previously</a>, including showing a banner about existing drafts when the compose box is open, so that's another way to solve this. Having the notification banner – or a persistent banner as also mentioned previously, or anything similar – catches the user sooner though, before they get up in frustration and fume for a while, only to come back ready to start writing the message again and see that it was there the whole time. <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span></p>",
