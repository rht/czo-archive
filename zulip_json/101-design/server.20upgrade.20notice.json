Not all server administrators subscribe to our announcement list or blog, or follow us on Twitter, so it's very possible for admins to be unaware when a new Zulip release comes out. We'd like to start showing a banner in the web app on self-hosted servers to encourage server admins to upgrade to the most recent stable release version, which has all the latest improvements and bug fixes (including security fixes).</p>\n<p>There are a bunch of questions about how best to communicate this message in a way that's helpful (and not too annoying ;). Here are some points for discussion:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Who should see a banner (e.g. admins? everyone?)?</li>\n<li>What should the banner(s) say?</li>\n<li>How dismissable should the banner(s) be?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that some of the answers to these questions could vary depending on how old the server version (e.g. prior stable release series vs. older).</p>\n<p>For reference, we <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/blob/v27.182/src/common/ServerCompatBanner.js#L53-L64\">show a banner in mobile apps</a> at startup for <em>very</em> old server versions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For admins: '{realm} is running Zulip Server {serverVersion}, which is unsupported. Please upgrade your server as soon as possible.'</li>\n<li>For non-admins: '{realm} is running Zulip Server {serverVersion}, which is unsupported.
