Let's say we add an option that allows orgs to upload a replacement logo, and we advertize it as roughly a 30px by 200px spot.</p>\n<p>Then, say a few months later we change the design of the nav bar area so that now there is only room for a 30px by 100px logo. All of our users will now have to go change their uploaded logos, which is a fairly big annoyance (i.e. more likely is that we will just never change the size of that whitespace.)</p>\n<p>Or, let's say a few months later we want to change that corner to be a workplace switcher, or settings dropdown, or anything else. I think allowing custom logos there will make it harder to make such a change.</p>\n<p>An alternative would be to just use the realm avatar there and put the name of the org in text.</p>",

My thought for this however is simple; let them upload any logo up to a 4:1 ratio (just a tad more horizontal than ours currently), and then we just make our designs around that, which I think is super feasible given that 4:1 means 120px wide, which is quite narrow.</p>",
