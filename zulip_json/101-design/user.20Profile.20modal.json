Quoting few quick  design related follow-ups Tim had from PR review:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>We should add an \"unsubscribe\" button to those tables if the current user is an administrator with permission to unsubscribe the user.</li>\n<li>We should think about adding a \"Filter\" widget.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",

Before proceeding too much on it I was thinking that we should extract user profile modal related functions in a separate module <code>user_profile_modal</code> and just have <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/433452a9b38ffd5664265e0ca9a829c7b41eb795/static/js/popovers.js#L501\"><code>show_user_info_popover</code></a> in popovers.js. This is because <code>user_profile_modal</code> related function are already cluttering much of popover.js and also we are adding more functionalities to this modal so its clutter in this file will increase and these are not any popover related function.<br>\nI wanted to confirm if it would be a good idea to do this refactor.</p>",
