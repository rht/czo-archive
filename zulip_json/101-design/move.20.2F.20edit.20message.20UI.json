This would be the \"Move topic\" modal we already have in the three-dot topic menu, with the addition of an option for which messages to move when evoked from the message menu.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/90/1c1Ia9wP6dSbTYq3828fZ6Lm/Screen-Shot-2022-09-29-at-1.27.14-PM.png\">Screen-Shot-2022-09-29-at-1.27.14-PM.png</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/90/1c1Ia9wP6dSbTYq3828fZ6Lm/Screen-Shot-2022-09-29-at-1.27.14-PM.png\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2022-09-29-at-1.27.14-PM.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/90/1c1Ia9wP6dSbTYq3828fZ6Lm/Screen-Shot-2022-09-29-at-1.27.14-PM.png\"></a></div></li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't show stream / topic in the message editing UI and the \"view source\" UI. You would just see the (editable or not, based on permissions) source of the message.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It seems like this should really simplify the UI for both actions. It has the down side of not being able to see the message(s) while you're doing the move, but seems worth it.</p>",
