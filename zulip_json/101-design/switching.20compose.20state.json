One common scenario for me is that I want to quote a message from a stream and reference it in a PM, so I use the <code>&gt;</code> hotkey to start a reply, but then I need to do <code>Ctrl+A, Ctrl+X, Esc, X, {specify recipient}, Ctrl+V</code> to get my content into the new reply (or something equivalent using the mouse).  Whereas if I wanted to do the same thing and send to a private stream, it's a lot simpler.</p>",
