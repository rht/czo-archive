Having said that, I like to be minimal, so I think it would be worthwhile to try just not having anything at the top, as Vlad suggests.  (experiment on czo)</p>",

I've always thought of this logo as a bit of a workaround. The design constraints here are basically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We need some vertical space above the top message to fit a \"loading messages above this point\" indicator, since it feels nice to have the loading indicator inline in the feed, not on top of the app. The loading indicator can have any shape that we want.</li>\n<li>It is a reasonably common situation when clicking into a topic view that the web app has all the messages in the topic cached, but does not know that it does until it asks the server, so the loading experience for clicking into a topic will often feature showing all the messages plus a loading indicator at the topic for &lt;0.5s depending on your network latency to the server. I don't expect this technical reality of how our caching system works (being much better at actually having all the messages than being certain it has all the messages and thus being able to skip asking the server for more) to change in the next year.</li>\n<li>Thus, we want the visual change when we go from the state of \"We have all the messages but are asking the server if there are more\" to \"We have all the messages and know it\" to be as non-abrupt as possible. Most important is that the height of this vertical space not change, since the alternative would jump the whole message feed 0.25s after loading it which feels very annoying. But probably also moving from a logo in the center to some left-aligned text might feel awkward.</li>\n<li>In some <code>near:</code> views, it's possible for scrolling to the bottom of a feed to need to fetch more messages, and we show a loading indicator for that situation; we want that loading indicator to have a design that feels consistent with the one at the top.</li>\n<li>We want something that doesn't feel super distracting/attention grabbing, so you don't end up reading it. I'm not a big fan of Slack's \"here's a giant message saying this is the start of your conversation with this user\" for that reason.</li>\n</ul>",

        "content": "<p>Oh, one more thing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There may be some minor utility in being able to move the selection box into the row containing the bottom-of-feed and top-of-feed loading indicators -- this would be convenient if we wanted to make clicking on a top take you to the message before the first unread message rather than first unread message. We're not at all sure we want to do that, as it has downsides in pushing the user's visual attention to start with a thing they've already read and there are other solutions to that problem that I currently think of as more promising, but it might end up being nice if the design we had did not make adding support for a blue box around it feel impossible.</li>\n</ul>",
