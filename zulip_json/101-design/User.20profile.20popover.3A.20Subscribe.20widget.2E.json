We should also add a \"View all streams\" link in case the user needs a more full-featured stream search/browsing experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But before starting the work, I want to discuss some low-level design decisions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where should we place the widget? Should it be positioned above the subscribed stream (headline + search bar) or below it? However, I believe keeping it below might create some confusion.</li>\n<li>Should we keep a text input and a disabled subscribe button until the user selects a stream from the typeahead? Alternatively, should we hide the subscribe button at all times until something is selected?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've tried to create a small overview of how I am thinking it should look.
