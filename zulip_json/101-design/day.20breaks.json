She was saying the main thing that made zulip's conversation model confusing at the beginning was not topics, but the the fact that even in topic narrows you have recipient blocks (due to day breaks). </p>\n<p>So you think you have an idea of what recipient blocks are, but then you get to the topic narrow and find out \"ok, it's something else .. maybe each recipient block is a conversation?\" which sets you on the wrong track. </p>\n<p>I do think in general having the date changes use the same visual semantics as stream/topic changes is not great. Figuring out that new recipient block means \"change of topic OR change of date\" does seem considerably trickier than if it were one or the other. And since a decent fraction of conversations last a day or more (or if you're remote, may go over midnight in your timezone even when the conversation only lasts a few hours), they show up all over the place. </p>\n<p>How hard would it be to change it so that we didn't start a new recipient block on day change? E.g. something like what the mobile app does.</p>",
