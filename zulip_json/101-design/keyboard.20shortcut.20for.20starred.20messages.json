        "content": "<p>Some of those discussions involve Zulip-terminal, where the left and right panels have always been keyboard-navigable (left/right or vim-equivalent). However, given our keyboard focus, we also moved to add shortcut/hot keys for all the top-left buttons that it directly supports. Without that, while out of compose one can always enter the left panel with one (or two) direction keys, but need to adjust focus to a given narrowing button, from what was potentially much further down in the left panel.</p>\n<p>Given an ongoing absence of keys in the web app to synchronize with, Zulip-terminal settled on (see <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip-terminal#intentional-differences\">https://github.com/zulip/zulip-terminal#intentional-differences</a>):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mentions [<code>#</code>]</li>\n<li>Starred messages [<code>f</code>] (~ messages you are 'following')</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ZT could certainly aim to support alternatives if the web app chose them. Within ZT, a key to effectively focus the top-left (like <code>g</code>) and use a scroll/hotkey there to select a narrowing button could be more direct than moving left and scrolling up from what could be somewhere much lower in the stream or topic list. However, I'd prefer single keys like we currently have, not only a sequence (<code>g &lt;key&gt;</code>). The reason for this is that narrowing in ZT is treated as maintaining message context (if possible), and I feel the fluidity of that could be lost if the focus jumps, when a single key is available.</p>",
