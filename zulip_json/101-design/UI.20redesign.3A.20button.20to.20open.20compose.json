        "content": "<p>This seems fairly promising. A few notes on details for the open compose state:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm not sure about the all-caps labels for STREAMS / DIRECT MESSAGES in that little menu - I feel like it might be better to just style it like other popover menus in the app.</li>\n<li>I assume it'll still be a lock icon or globe to the left of the stream if the currently selected stream is one of those types; something to keep in mind. I'm also not sure we need the background color around that icon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The main thing I'm worried about is having <code>Topic:</code> in grey font always visible inside the topic input box. I think it's fine as a placeholder, but I feel like that could end up feeling pretty weird/distracting, especially in any languages where <code>Topic</code> gets translated to something that's like 12 characters. Directionally, I'd rather move towards removing the <code>To:</code> in favor of say, a person icon, over adding <code>Topic:</code> here; once you've sent like 5 messages, you know that box is the topic box, and I think it'd feel to users like clutter. That clutter effect is amplified if we end up with \"New topic\" inside that input area as well.</p>\n<p>One idea for resolving that bundle of issues would be to use the space that you currently have \"NEW TOPIC\" in for \"View topic\"; and trying to fit advertising \"New topic\" as something managed via the typeahead after clicking into that input box, rather than an always visible button. Something I like about having \"View topic\" in that location is that it can only be visible when you're actually viewing the topic. </p>\n<p>That pattern would also let us have the \"View conversation\" button appear inside the right of the private message recipient area when you're looking at something else might feel consistent an intuitive, replacing \"Click on the <code>To</code> button\" approach we've been trying, which I can see working but feels a lot less discoverable.</p>\n<p>Another benefit of this approach would be that there would be a clear visual signal in the compose box when you're viewing something different from where you're composing. The main downside is that potentially changing what you're viewing with compose to a group PM conversation open would involve the compose box visually changing to line-wrap differently. Though depending what strings we pick, it could be a small effect; \"GO TO\" would be pretty minimal, vs. something like \"View conversation\".</p>",
