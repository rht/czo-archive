The old Zulip behavior was to do what we do in other narrows, taking you to the first unread match (if any) and otherwise the latest match.  This was particularly poor behavior if you have any streams muted or not read.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/648a60baf63f9afade83148bd9ae1fc480510178\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/648a60baf63f9afade83148bd9ae1fc480510178\">648a60baf63f9afade83148bd9ae1fc480510178</a> a few months ago, we changed just full-text search queries to instead take you to the latest messages, and also configured those narrows to never mark messages as read (so you don't need to worry about losing state).</p>\n<p>The change merged today fixed a bug in that positioning logic that caused it to still take you to the first unread messages in some corner cases (e.g. with matches in a muted stream, I think?).  And the one I've test-deployed extends this search behavior to other searches that may not have a full-text keyword, e.g. <code>sender:</code>, where you're not getting the whole conversation and thus marking messages as read and/or taking you to the first unread message would also be counterproductive.</p>",
