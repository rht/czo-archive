I'll attach the changes done below as a gif and then explain my changes,</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/c/Yv0165b6FYUhKX22WvIO2ewk/full-profile-design-improvements.gif\">full-profile-design-improvements.gif</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/c/Yv0165b6FYUhKX22WvIO2ewk/full-profile-design-improvements.gif\" title=\"full-profile-design-improvements.gif\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/c/Yv0165b6FYUhKX22WvIO2ewk/full-profile-design-improvements.gif\"></a></div><p>Changes</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I have moved the title of the modal to the header, which no longer scrolls when you scroll through the profile information. Having the name always on the top is just intuitive, we would want to have relate the name to the profile information.</li>\n<li>I also made the tab switcher fixed, as one might one to jump between the tabs while in between scrolling through one, again, the context of what we are seeing just helps.</li>\n<li>Changed the modal header to a darker colour, similar to some other modals, which helps with completing the look.</li>\n<li>Shifted modal title to the left, since we are displaying names, it's very likely that we will come across long names, left alignment of the title will help with accommodating longer names. Also helps with uniformity wrt other modals.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Other changes that I would like to discuss,</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There seems to be some ambiguity between the modal headers, some seem to have the darker overlay and some don't. There's even variation in the padding and margin between the modal headers. Hence there's just many variations between the modals, I think unifying the CSS of all the modals would really help.</li>\n<li>Changing the position of the user presence icon as suggested by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"7\">@Tim Abbott</span> in  <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"9\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/9-issues/topic/bad.20avatar.20alignment.20in.20full.20profile\">#issues &gt; bad avatar alignment in full profile</a>, for activity status people will generally tend to look it up from the buddy list sidebar, and it would be a good idea to continue forward that design.</li>\n<li>If we proceed to place the preview profile button below the avatar (<a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"137\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/137-feedback/topic/Make.20preview.20profile.20sticky\">#feedback &gt; Make preview profile sticky</a> ), it would be a good idea to move the edit profile button from the modal header, convert it to a modal button and also place it below the avatar to maintain continuity between preview/edit.</li>\n</ol>",
