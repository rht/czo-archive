In the issue description, it was mentioned to convert all text to pills with avatars, including the Bots page. However, doing so caused issues on narrow screens, as there are multiple columns in the Bots page, and the pills with avatars take up more space. As a result, the bot names disappear, and only the avatars remain, which is not the expected behavior. I have opened a pull request with all the changes mentioned in the issue description, but in the Bots page, I have kept only the pills without avatars. I would appreciate suggestions for the Bots page.<br>\nPR: <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/24308\">#24308</a><br>\nIssue: <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/24229\">#24229</a></p>\n<p><strong>Pill with avatar:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/dc/4_q5SwN0wF87xkqNuWmgrfJ1/Screenshot-from-2023-02-09-00-51-56.png\">Screenshot-from-2023-02-09-00-51-56.png</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/dc/4_q5SwN0wF87xkqNuWmgrfJ1/Screenshot-from-2023-02-09-00-51-56.png\" title=\"Screenshot-from-2023-02-09-00-51-56.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/dc/4_q5SwN0wF87xkqNuWmgrfJ1/Screenshot-from-2023-02-09-00-51-56.png\"></a></div><p><strong>without avatar:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/bb/_y0tgudscuNuq-iWoaVaYr61/Screenshot-from-2023-02-10-01-23-45.png\">Screenshot-from-2023-02-10-01-23-45.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/bb/_y0tgudscuNuq-iWoaVaYr61/Screenshot-from-2023-02-10-01-23-45.png\" title=\"Screenshot-from-2023-02-10-01-23-45.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/bb/_y0tgudscuNuq-iWoaVaYr61/Screenshot-from-2023-02-10-01-23-45.png\"></a></div>",

But for every even row, we don't have a background color, and we inherit one with high transparency, making the content clearly visible behind it.</p>\n<p>There are two possible solutions to this issue. One is to give the entire user column a single background color for screen width below <code>450px</code> so that all the content will be hidden. Another option is to insert a div element between the user column and the content scrolling behind it and give that div a background color, creating a sandwich effect that hides the content behind it.  Just wanted some suggestions on which approach would be more appropriate.</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Issue:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/33/lbbPeDsmJSIraDcVvo38W_r0/issue_with_bg_color.gif\">issue_with_bg_color.gif</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/33/lbbPeDsmJSIraDcVvo38W_r0/issue_with_bg_color.gif\" title=\"issue_with_bg_color.gif\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/33/lbbPeDsmJSIraDcVvo38W_r0/issue_with_bg_color.gif\"></a></div><hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Same background color:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/cf/WVMq5ybDrUbFBhCnr9ib0QIn/same_background_color.gif\">same_background_color.gif</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/cf/WVMq5ybDrUbFBhCnr9ib0QIn/same_background_color.gif\" title=\"same_background_color.gif\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/cf/WVMq5ybDrUbFBhCnr9ib0QIn/same_background_color.gif\"></a></div>",
