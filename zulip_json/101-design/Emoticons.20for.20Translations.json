Originally the list was going to be pretty short in order to prevent false positives, but it would be great to hear suggestions as to <strong>how long the list of translate-able emoticons should be</strong> as well as <strong>which emoticons Zulip users want to be translated</strong>. Any feedback would be appreciated. Thanks!</p>",
