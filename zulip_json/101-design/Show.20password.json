I tried mocking <code>tippy</code> which didn't seem to work hence changed few other properties under <code>document</code> which doesn't effect other tests. There is one visual issue/behaviour however, when a new instance of the tooltip is created on changing <code>label</code>, it is showed above the older instances. Hence when we hover over the icon, the instances are loaded progressively with latest over the top. This process is very quick, but if one focuses on the tooltips, they can see the instances loading. I guess this isn't an issue apparently as this something with tippy itself (I tried few unsuccessful debugs).</p>",
