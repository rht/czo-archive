For starters, the avatars would be around 18x18 which is really, really tiny, and with multiple people reacting you're either making the pills quite wide and visually heavy by having the emoji and then multiple images, until suddenly they become comparably understated when you switch to numbers only (without avatars at all). And if you wanted to make them less overstated, you could overlap the images and then destroy most of the ability to see who actually reacted in the avatars (eg it would only be useful from an ornamentation perspective).</p>",
