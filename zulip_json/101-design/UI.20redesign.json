It's funny because everyone seems to be so focused on dark mode lately and they're not focusing on building good \"light\" themes and designs as much anymore. </p>\n<p>Few things that stand out from a design perspective to me: </p>\n<p>The bigger bolder fonts are definitely in. Notably Apple is pivoting towards bigger and bolder fonts as well with macOS Big Sur and iOS 14 <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur-preview/\">https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur-preview/</a> I usually follow Apple when it comes to design trends like this, especially since so many people use Macs now, matching the UI/UX elements for the next version of mac/iOS helps keep the apps looking like they belong by following similar design principles.</p>\n<p>I also like the rounded user icons, and the white space utilization is pretty good although maybe a little too much in some splaces. There's definitely some crowding in Zulip's design where a few extra pixels of padding could go along way.</p>\n<p>Things I don't like about this design is there's too many different similar yet contrasting shades of grey. I definitely prefer Zulip's more effective utilization of just plain white.</p>\n<p>If there is anything we could borrow from this from a design perspective, I'd say circular icons, bigger and bolder fonts, and increasing our padding / spacing (not much, just a few pixels in some cases).</p>",

As it is now, when I'm in all messages, I need to scan upwards, but for stream/topic narrows I should look in the navbar (if we remove it from the recipient bar there).

So PMs and Users can be accessible from same space. New user can be also invited from here. You may keep the right side bar for bigger screens, but should show other important info of selected stream/user/group. I will try to share the right bar design also. </li>\n<li>All Streams, PMs and topics should be arranged as per latest message on top. </li>\n<li>No need to have a date divider in between messages as the date is always shows on top right corner and hardly identifiable in current UI. </li>\n<li>No need to have a box for a message thread to unclutter the screen further. </li>\n<li>Users can be invited and new stream can be created from '+' icon beside search icon. So removing links to give more space and cleanliness to left sidebar. </li>\n<li>Adding three dot action menu next to search icon on top right for actions on stream same as it is available on left side bar.     </li>\n<li>Other UI functionality like mouse hover, actions, message body etc remain as it is. </li>\n<li>Stream heading on top remain same.

We can follow each of which with the magical feature of Zulip: distinguishing the messages by the meaningful topics and the insane high speed search among whole archive of messages. No more slack messages, alert emails or SMS (I appreciate that, Really thanks for it guys!)</p>\n<p>But like any other features in the IT world, It has its pros and cons. I believe that it's not ideal for our daily routine chats. It lacks of many UI/UX facilities, which makes it hard to use, not only for the normal users, but also for the technical team. I couldn't urge our teams to use it. They switched back to the WhatsApp cancer!</p>\n<p>i.e. I wanna send a direct  message to someone.  Here's the scenario:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I should find them among the list of users. Most of the times I should click on the magnifier icon, which is small. and search for their names. Because they have no avatars. Or as the other option: I should go over the online users, if he/she is offline.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>or the scenario of writing a message in a stream:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I gonna send them a message. So, I start typing. But, no! I should've clicked on the text box, earlier. I don't need keyboard shortcuts.</li>\n<li>Oh, I should also set the topic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>OK, separated topics for receiving loads of messages is ideal. but for the daily chats, having just the concept of stream is enough. (so, maybe we should have a concept of topic-less streams in Zulip in the feature? I don't know, but I failed to make the team to write their messages in the correct topic.) </p>\n<p>After all, we decided to keep Zulip to receive the messages from our infrastructure. But for the chat purpose, we gonna use sth like <a href=\"http://Element.io\">Element.io</a>. It has also additional features like sending voice messages.<br>\nSorry to say that and Also for my grammar. I hope that I could've give you the necessary feedback from our sides.</p>\n<p>Cheers guys!</p>",

The call for \"modern\" layouts like what Xavier asks for.... No thanks. <br>\nI like the compact layout with little wasted real estate. To me, I like a small font with compact layout so that as much content is available on screen at a time. I would want to be able to make it even vore compact: Be able to hide the profile pictures and reclaim the wasted space below them. I just need messages to be prefixed by nick/name. Similar to Slack \"Compact\" theme. I shall post an example.<br>\nWhat others call \"visual noise\", I consider \"having info and functionality available immediately onscreen. Most of the points Xavier points out, are things I like. But I am an old geek. IRC user from early 90s up until the 2010s. Then we used Slack at my company for a few years. We old schoolers just ran it compact. Then we moved to Zulip and never looked back. (I have also used Discord a little. ) There may be colleagues (30 total) who think similarly to Xavier et al, but they are few and don't voice their opinion.<br>\nSo I understand that people may think differently, maybe folks who grew up with Discord and Slack, and maybe with iOS or Android as their primary computing device. These are matters of taste and habit. Therefore, I hope Zulip do not make radical changes until they have a theme-based setup that let's us choose. Remember that there are surely quite a few of us who think that the different design of Zulip is one of the aspects that make it <em>better</em> than Discord and the likes of it. If you prefer Discord - use Discord.... :P<br>\nBut if you give us choice, that is nice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>choice of layouts. \"Old school\", \"Discord like\" (or what you want to call it), more. I.e. \"layoyt\" means (typo)graphical.</li>\n<li>choice of amount of info on screen in terms of more or less. Do you want old-school like a F16 HUD or minimalistic?</li>\n<li>choice of hiding panes.

The elements you remove in the mockup are info to me, like people panel with statuses, stream info in top bar and much more. <br>\nLike I don't need to have the top bar void, just dead space, when I actually do not search. The dual functionality today of the top bar showing info, and then when you click search, the bar is used to type the actual search - that is just perfect. To me. Hence, the info density is by definition less for me and anyone who prefer to have that information present. Of course it is different for someone who considers it \"noise\" or \"clutter\".<br>\nAs said, this is extremely subjective. E.g. I don't see a point in having a color difference between the panes, but it doesn't bother me either - as long as there is still a dark mode palette (as an <em>option</em>). I run as many apps as possible dark, I find the old-school white screens tiresome. But that is just me.

Just the fact that a) my preferences go in the opposite direction on almost every point, and b) some people obviously agree with me since it was designed this way in the first place - that should be enough.<br>\nSo pretty please, sugar on top, let all of these design  changes be options.

Very good overall direction—much cleaner and more modern while still being Zulip.</p>\n<p>To address some of the questions you brought up in the video:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our main scrollbar is on the browser’s right so that users with large screens have the entire browser window as a target area where they can use the scroll wheel or touchpad scroll gestures. Visually moving the scrollbar without breaking this would require some kind of kludge that listens for scroll events and manually translates them in code to scrolling movement; such emulation inevitably results in laggy awkward behavior that feels much worse than the platform’s native scrolling.</li>\n<li>The Zulip logo in the top-left corner is customizable, and we expect organizations to replace it with their own logo, but it would be reasonable to streamline the default logo we use there.</li>\n<li>The multiple new-message buttons are an effort to nudge new users toward keeping the discussion organized. There’s a concern, for example, that if starting a new topic were to take more clicks or be less discoverable than replying to an existing topic, it would become much more common for new users to randomly append new discussions to unrelated topics. There’s room for different ideas here; we’d need to do user testing to be sure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(FYI, Alya and Tim are on vacation, so their availability will be limited for a while.)</p>",

For example, as Vlad mentioned, Discord wants to be \"fun\", so they gladly sacrifice information density for visual flair.  Slack wants to be simple, so they sacrifice some convenience in the name of cleanness.  And Zulip has its own constraints.  I'm not saying designers have gotten it completely right on any of the products, but I do think folks have a tendency for complaining that the orange doesn't taste like an apple.</p>",

Conceptually \"my\" settings being near my user makes sense at some level, but there's a lot more in the menu than that (not least of which organization settings). </li>\n<li>Use subtle darker/lighter shading for the columns and skip those gridlines <span aria-label=\"+1\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f44d\" role=\"img\" title=\"+1\">:+1:</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I think those two could be impactful alone and are less controversial than others that have been raised in this topic!</p>",

I think we could plausibly remove it with a combination of:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Showing the info in a tooltip when hovering over the name of the stream in the top bar.</li>\n<li>Making the info easier to find in the menus (e.g. at the moment, subscriber count is shown in the left panel but not the right panel).</li>\n<li>Implementing pinned topics (<a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19483\">#19483</a>), which will be a good way to share important links and other info.</li>\n</ol>",

A few specific notes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I don't have a clear idea on how to manage the unread counts so that they are readable and look good with the grey background; we may need to play with a few options on CZO. I feel like the current UI where they are very distinct helps with identifying which streams to read, but it may be fine to have it be more subtle.</li>\n<li>For PMs, I'm hoping it'll work well to put them into a separate section, as described in <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19447\">#19447</a>. That way it'll take fewer clicks to get to them, and it should be more discoverable for new users.</li>\n<li>For managing muted streams, we have a rough plan to break the left sidebar into sections, as described in <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19812\">#19812</a>. That may affect how folks feel about the icons.</li>\n<li>It seems like the stream colors are moderately helpful to folks. We also have an idea about letting org admins set default stream colors (<a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/17968\">#17968</a>), which will potentially make them even more useful.</li>\n<li>I think reducing the margin to the right of the unread counts looks good (see screenshot <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"9808\">Yash RE</span> posted above); we'd need to play with how it feels when the unread count moves on hover to make room for the three-dot menu.

We could play with removing the stream name, but I think even as it is users sometimes find it confusing what stream they are looking at and/or composing to. If we go that route, we may need to make the stream name in the top bar stand out more.</p>\n<p>For the compose box, Zulip has a long history of new users finding it hard to figure out how to send a message. We only stopped hearing that after the change (made in 2021) that introduced the long \"Message stream &gt; topic\" button. So while I think the current three-button setup is far from perfect, I think it'll be a whole mini-project to figure out how to improve it without re-introducing confusion for new users. And of course, as I think Vlad mentioned, having a single compose button requires other changes to the compose experience.

By the way Slack doesn't have counters for channels, I guess they realized that it doesn't matter the number.

There is emply/half-filled/fill circles that are 3 different states and all mean something different. Then there is Green/Brown/Grey that mean something else. Having both different circle-states and different color-states is confusing to me. It seems like we should pick <em>either</em> Circles ... or ... Color to indicate state - not both. My preference would be to just use different purple-colored circles. So a full-purple color circle, a half-filled purple circle, and an empty purple circle. All these purple circle icon styles would be similar in style to the purple icons found in the top left of the Channel (Left) Pane.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>LEFT PANE:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I see world icons, hash tags and lock symbols all next to channel name. Very similar comment to the People Pain comment in that, it seems like we should pick just 1 thing to provide an indicator, that being either: Hashtags or Icons but not both icons and hashtags. (If it's going to be an icon, then the icons style and color should match the icons in the top left for \"All Messages\", \"Mentions\" etc). My person preference is to have the purple line-style icons for everything in the Left Pane, meaning the world icon is a purple-line style icon, ALL hashtags are purple, the lock is a purple-line style icon.</li>\n</ul>",

Simply put bug fixes and accepting some opinions about UI design because I should listen to people who used the Zulip for a long time and pick my fights <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>\n<p>So, there is no Reply button here since the whole concept of a \"single button\" is questionable and I want to address that in a separate discussion, so I just removed out of this screen.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I still get confused why both circles and color are indicating some type of user state.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mike people got confused about 4 types of statuses in general. But it is not the reason to remove them, since there is a legacy audience which understand them. If we would have 2 statuses, sure we can do 2  colors like in your example. If you search in Zulip there are  conversations about it Keep in mind that in the new design there is no half-filled circle. There are online users (traditionally green) and offline users (empty circle), there are also zombie users (idle status is zombie green) and \"don't talk to me users\" (don't disturb is like offline but with a line inside it - this one I didn't design yet)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>we should pick just 1 thing to provide an indicator</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Streams can be regular, public and private. All 3 options are indicated with an icon (#, globe, lock).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any stream traditionally can have a color, which any user can override. So if you want all of your streams to be colorless, you can do such thing in your client (for now this isn't syncing across all of clients of a single user).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your suggested design looks solid but you removed 2 big features out of the product. I'm not in the position to remove features, since I'm not Product Manager here. And to be honest I don't think that removing colors from streams and decreasing possible user statuses is an obvious improvement to the product... Yes it's making visual picture calmer... but you can change colors on your side and you can collapse both user lists to don't see those statuses at all.</p>",
