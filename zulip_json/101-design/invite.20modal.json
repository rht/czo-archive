How \"Streams they should join\" should look like, e.g. a list of streams or pills of streams (I guess pills of streams)<br>\n2. What should be the behaviour of above option initially e.g. we want to show \"Edit\" with default streams or we should directly able to add streams when someone open the invite modal. (maybe later one would be better)<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"131\">@Rishi Gupta</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"7\">@Tim Abbott</span></p>",
