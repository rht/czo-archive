But 8.5em is a fine default, and doing something dynamic on height might get tricky (since we need to think about mobile/widescreen/tall/etc. cases).  We do need to be careful if we make this dymanic to not introduce bugs that only impact windows that have been resized.  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>what's the cutoff to condense (65% now, 30% on my PR, maybe meet in the middle)?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>we're talking about what fraction of the screen causes condensing?  I think 30% is definitely too low; because condensing something is a worse UX than just showing the same thing if the heights will be the same, we definitely want the cutoff to be significantly larger than the height of condensed messages (otherwise, what's the point?).</p>\n<p>Is there a significant problem with our current parameters?
