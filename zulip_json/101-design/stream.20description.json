So I wanted to look through the descriptions of all the streams in my left sidebar and see which one would be appropriate. However, I found myself dissatisfied with the amount of effort needed to discover the purpose of a stream. </p>\n<p>Currently, I have to open up the stream settings in order to see what a stream is about. Not only is this one click too many for me, but it is not very intuitive in my mind.</p>\n<p>I searched the chat and found <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/8707\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/8707\">#8707</a> (put the stream description in the stream popover), which I think would be a great step in the right direction; however, as Tim pointed out, this would be problematic for longer descriptions.</p>\n<p>What I would like to see is something along the lines of what Slack does with the \"channel topic\". Whenever you are viewing a channel, the channel topic is displayed at the top.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/20/f95FLat41KomHb6notDIBwFI/Screen-Shot-2018-04-09-at-1.48.01-PM.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2018-04-09-at-1.48.01-PM.png\">Screen-Shot-2018-04-09-at-1.48.01-PM.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/20/f95FLat41KomHb6notDIBwFI/Screen-Shot-2018-04-09-at-1.48.01-PM.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2018-04-09-at-1.48.01-PM.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/20/f95FLat41KomHb6notDIBwFI/Screen-Shot-2018-04-09-at-1.48.01-PM.png\"></a></div><p>I'd like to hear people's thoughts on this.</p>",
