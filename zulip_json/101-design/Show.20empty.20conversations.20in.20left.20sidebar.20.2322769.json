While I was working on this issue, I had two choices for implementation and was wondering which one would be better.</p>\n<p>When you navigate to an empty conversation, the name of the recipient will appear at the top of the list in the DM section. However, there are two choices regarding when the name should be removed from the list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the compose box is closed or narrowed to somewhere else.</li>\n<li>If narrowed to somewhere else.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have attached a demo for the first point where I have shown the compose box being closed, as that is the only distinct factor in both choices.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/a9/YO7rdT7Ht7wPtH51n_xy93Yd/empty_convo.gif\">empty_convo.gif</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/a9/YO7rdT7Ht7wPtH51n_xy93Yd/empty_convo.gif\" title=\"empty_convo.gif\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/a9/YO7rdT7Ht7wPtH51n_xy93Yd/empty_convo.gif\"></a></div>",

This way, the user will be aware that they intentionally clicked on the button, and it can be seen as more of a preview. I am considering this because, in general, if you search for someone's name in the search bar and go to a direct message with that person, it might be confusing why the person's name is appearing on the left sidebar. What are your thoughts on this approach?</p>",

This provides assurance that the conversation is actually empty. Therefore, instead of checking every possible way if the conversation is not appearing upon refresh or in similar scenarios, coupling the narrow banner with this concept covers all scenarios. Please let me know if you want me to explore a different approach.</p>",
