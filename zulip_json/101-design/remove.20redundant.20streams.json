Anything but the slightest border radius gives me that playdoh feeling. I'm not fond of the tab idea, I think it boxes conversations too much in. While the relation between messages in different topics is only chronologically, they still \"fit together\" in my mind, and de-emphasizing the relation between topics/streams feels wrong. But I liked when Material design reduced an input field to a single line, so... <em>shrughs</em> You know, personal opinion.</p>",
