I decided that a subtle but effective way to show that was to change the left-border-color for unread messages.  But I don't want the current red color I prototyped, which is literally HTML \"red\".  If you like this approach, then we need a better color here.  I think the red family is good, but a nicer shade of red.</p>\n<p>It's also possible that we should indicate the view's cannot-read-ness in some other way too.  If we can put some banner on the top, that will also allow us to go back into can-actually-read mode without knowing about the \"N\" key.  The banner could say something like \"Click to begin marking messages as read again\" (but better wording).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You're probably going to go with the banner approach that <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"19257\">Alya Abbott</span> <a href=\"#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/mark.20as.20unread/near/1205669\">suggested</a>, but if you don't go that direction please be sure to use a color combination that is not red/green for the <a href=\"https://99designs.com/blog/tips/designers-need-to-understand-color-blindness/#:~:text=Avoid%20the%20following%20color%20combinations,Green%20%26%20Grey%3B%20Green%20%26%20Black\">color blind user population</a>.</p>",

I think in fact best practice goes further than that: we should never rely solely on color to communicate something. If we're using a color contrast to indicate something, then we should also find another way to indicate it at the same time, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>different texture, different stroke type, different stroke width</li>\n<li>different icon</li>\n<li>different text</li>\n<li>different text style (other than color), like bold</li>\n</ul>",

It helps me quickly see, OK, <em>here's</em> the messages I haven't read yet; above that are the messages that I saw in the past and probably don't need to read again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'd be concerned about the dot not being as effective at giving that cue.</p>\n<p>One thing about it is that because it's just at one spot in the message, rather than being continuous along the message's height, it's not as visually dependable. If I see some blue (or gray) dots in one area, then some space above them that doesn't have any dots… that could mean that's the start of the unreads (and I can ignore anything above), or it could just mean the next message up is a long one (in which case that's probably extra important to read!). So I have to take extra time to carefully scan upward to find there's definitely a message-top up there and there's still no dot there.</p>\n<p>Certainly this is something we could try an experiment to learn more about, though.</p>",

Please understand me correctly here. All people in some cases/conditions/environments need something to help them to feel better, so there might be many, not critical accessibility problems. For me small font size is an accessibility problem, for someone too many colors is an accessibility problem, not having 100% keyboard-oriented interfaces is an accessibility problem for other people. I was very surprised to see the terminal version of Zulip, and yet some people find that more accessible.  <br>\nZulip has a big list of messages and some people target their eye with <strong>mouse cursor</strong>, some with <strong>blue rectangle</strong>, some use <strong>both</strong>, some use <strong>none</strong>. <br>\nFor example, I don't like to read close to a top or bottom border, in my case Zulip blue rectangle usually stays on top while the mouse pointer is in the center but I don't touch it and scroll messages with a trackpad, so I'm kind of scrolling content to be under a mouse cursor.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Confusion is always against conversion in digital products.</h3>\n<p>Right now blue rectangle is a significant source of such and we should fix that issue. I don't know the solution. I suggest we think about it over the weekend.<br>\nHere are possible paths to take (subjectivly from me):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make currently blue rectangle to be a single thing that can mark the message as read (open to still have a context menu per message where you can individually selectively mark messages as read). Such an approach allows us to put additional features/modes/properties to this blue box if we want, for example, \"don't mark messages as read now\". <em>A special feature of the Zulip path.</em></li>\n<li>\n<p>Make the currently blue rectangle appear only when a person star's using the keyboard. Such an approach is even in HTML standard already and supported by browsers: the ability to show browser's focus ring only when <code>tab</code> is pressed. <em>Accessibility path</em><br>\nThis second option requires having the invisible focus on some messages, so <code>r</code> can still work, I suggest here to use currently hovered message, and if there is no hovered message, use the current blue box logic but just don't show it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make the current blue box very low contrast but still visible. Example <a href=\"/user_uploads/2/53/UlYo9ecTkt7EJ29lKujl79hz/image.png\">image.png</a> . <strong>Hiding a problem path</strong></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/53/UlYo9ecTkt7EJ29lKujl79hz/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/53/UlYo9ecTkt7EJ29lKujl79hz/image.png\"></a></div></li>\n<li>Create an option to turn off the blue box rectangle in the setting. Should it be turned off for new users by default?</li>\n</ol>",
