I think this might have made sense in the past, but doesn't make sense today. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most products' invitation emails are giant CTA plus decorative text, and I think that's the right model for zulip as well. Google groups is the one holdout that I know, and I've never used their custom body feature for actual content.</li>\n<li>It's one more barrier in the onboarding flow; i.e. one more thing to think about between signing up for zulip and inviting your boss to check it out. </li>\n<li>It's a lot of work to make it a good experience. Email is already hard, and with custom body we have to design an email that works regardless of what content is in the custom body. E.g. currently we'd like our invite email to be a giant CTA with decorative text. But that is at odds with having custom body text that is meant to be read.</li>\n<li>There's work remaining to make it a good experience in the invite modal, and to include the custom body in resent invitations.</li>\n<li>There are lots of non-email ways to invite people nowadays, where custom body won't apply anyway. E.g. posting a multiuse invite link to a facebook group, or posting just the bare URL for an open realm.</li>\n<li>If you need to append a long message to an email invitation, I think the right solution is a \"copy invite link\", and then you can take that invite link and embed it in a fully custom email, that you can write in your email client.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I guess that was a bit longer than intended, but thoughts?</p>",
