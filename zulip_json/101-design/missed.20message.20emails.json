One reason is so that they are usable in a wider variety of contexts, e.g. for people using Zulip from their email, or sending Zulip to email for compliance.

I like having the recipient header, since it means you can click on the email headings to e.g. open a Zulip window narrowed to the stream or topic, just like you can in Zulip.  And obviously the \"click here\" thing should be a button, not a link.</li>\n<li>I think the information on how to reply to the message at the bottom is fairly important, but could be compressed.  I should also note that the sentence about not replying is I think only present if you don't have the email mirror setup on the server; otherwise, we don't display that warning, because replying just works.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Possibly our first step in working on these should be to redo the structure of e.g. the unsusbcribe notices to match what we do in our other emails and look nice, since that'd significantly declutter these, and then think about the text.  I'm having a hard time imagining what different options might be like after doing that preparatory work.</p>",

Front, Google Voice and Slack email notifications all have centered-content, and I think all are a substantially worse experience than GitHub's emails notifications.</p>\n<p>Here's an example GitHub notification<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/72/FJz63Jk7ejpv20iv1utpU01r/pasted_image.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"pasted_image.png\">pasted image</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/72/FJz63Jk7ejpv20iv1utpU01r/pasted_image.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"pasted image\"><img data-src-fullsize=\"/thumbnail?url=user_uploads%2F2%2F72%2FFJz63Jk7ejpv20iv1utpU01r%2Fpasted_image.png&amp;size=full\" src=\"/thumbnail?url=user_uploads%2F2%2F72%2FFJz63Jk7ejpv20iv1utpU01r%2Fpasted_image.png&amp;size=thumbnail\"></a></div>",
