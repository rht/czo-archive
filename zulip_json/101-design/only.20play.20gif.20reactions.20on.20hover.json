If a setting is needed, should it be a user display setting or something else?</p>\n<p>I'm also assuming that we want to behave in the same way for all emoji, so whatever choice is made would apply to status emoji in the buddy list as well as the emoji introduced by <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/20019\">#20019</a> (pm list and on the message_body near the username), but feel free to suggest something different.</p>",
