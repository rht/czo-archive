For us we've likely have <code>P</code> switch to \"open/switch to PM list\", and ideally migrate <code>S</code> to be the equivalent for streams (instead of changing narrow, and remove <code>s</code> for use elsewhere, given the use of <code>z</code> in ZT). I'm undecided on the \"tab\" vs \"show/hide\" designs - it likely depends on the situation: how many unreads you have, or how far back in PM history (ordered by time) you want to be aware of.</p>",
