If 4% is too extreme, I would propose a 2% tweak, try it out here, and see if we get any pushback.  (It's a little tricky to get data here, since the premise of the background is that newbies can grok interleaved streams, which is really hard to measure, but we can treat feedback with a grain of salt.)</p>",
