The <a href=\"https://chat.zulip.org/#settings/uploaded-files\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://chat.zulip.org/#settings/uploaded-files\">Uploaded files</a> list didn't seem to have any obvious initial sorting. It wasn't until I stumbled over <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/6747\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/6747\">this</a> PR that I realized clicking on one of the fields would sort the files accordingly. This was because hovering over the fields didn't give me any visual feedback that these are clickable. </p>\n<p>I suggest</p>\n<ul>\n<li>initially sort all files by date</li>\n<li>make the info titles more button-ish. Provide a visual feedback on hovering and clicking.</li>\n</ul>",
