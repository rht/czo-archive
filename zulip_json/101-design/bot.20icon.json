One is just to open the PR as-is and note that it's blocked by <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/25997\">#25997</a>. Once that has been merged--and I'm not sure how soon that will happen--you can rebase your branch from  <code>main</code>, which should leave nothing but your commits--possibly with a merge conflict or two, but those happen.</p>",
