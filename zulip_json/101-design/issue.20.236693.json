I want to ask few things first.<br>\nTo add this new feature of subscribe stream on basis of user interest. Here is what I have thought. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add this page after registration page ('account\\register')</li>\n<li>Provide option of \"skip this for now\"</li>\n<li>I am not sure for url of this page. like it can be 'account\\register\\stream_subscribe' or 'account\\stream_subscribe' </li>\n<li>And then according to this name of url, I will add html file, view function in 'register.py' and requirements.</li>\n</ul>",
