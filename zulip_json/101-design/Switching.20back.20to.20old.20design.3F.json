But I'd like to talk about options we can offer that might help with compactness. I'm going to write up some numbers comparing the two, but can you talk a bit about how you use Zulip (E.g. do you use interleaved views like \"all messages\" view a lot?)?</p>",

One can account for those 16px as follows:<br>\n    * The bar at the top went from 24px to 30px (and from 22px =&gt; 30px for private messages; I have no idea why it was previously 2px shorter before).<br>\n    * There's 5px of new padding between the recipient bar and the top of the first message in a recipient group. This was required to support the cleaner/thinner blue box design -- because it's no longer on the outside edge of the message, it needs to have a space to sit where it's not hitting either the top of the message (where we display the sender) or the recipient bar; both of which would look ugly.<br>\n    * There's 5px of new padding after the very last message in a recipient group. This is added for the same reason of the top padding.</li>\n</ul>",

Removing completely the two 5px top/bottom paddings looks ugly if you actually look at the details when the first/last message is selected. I think it's possible there's a version somewhere in between might support a viable \"dense mode\", but I'm not sure; certainly when played with changing the recipient bar height from 30px to 26px, that looks passable as a \"dense mode\", but is only saving 4px, so doesn't seem worth bothering with a setting for.</p>\n<p>I'd like to understand more deeply the motivation for wanting more density -- if the problem is JUST in search views, for example, I'd want to consider making a tweak to how to do those for everyone just for those views. Certainly search views have this overhead around every single message they display.</p>",

I had to do the analysis above to confirm my understanding, but I think we've actually as of this checkpoint increased the density of messages within a single topic by a few percent. My guess is that the user's concern has to do with interleaved views and/or search views, where density is considerably less.</p>",
