But it does not solve the issue <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/20284\">#20284</a> which is to add proper aria-label for the \"3 dot menus\" in the left side bar. Currently the \"3 dot menus\" are not accesible by the screen readers, so the function associated with those \"3 dot menus\" are not accessible by persons who use screen readers to navigate over the website. This is because of \"aria-hidden=true\" for those icons in the left sidebar. In order to solve this issue I have to put some proper aria-labels for these \"3 dot menus\" in the left sidebar. So plz suggest labels for the \"3 dot menu icons\" in the left sidebar, so that the screen readers can depict the actual use of these \"3 dot menus\". <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"19257\">@Alya Abbott</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"7\">@Tim Abbott</span></p>",
