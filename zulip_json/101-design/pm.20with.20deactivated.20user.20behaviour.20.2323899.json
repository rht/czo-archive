One of the approaches could be to change the color of the compass box message area to look more like a disabled one, would be great to hear more approaches and suggestions to make the UI much better and more user-friendly. Thanks.</p>\n<p>currently the compose box in this case looks like this,<br>\n<a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68962290/209488799-912d0c5f-c379-4a98-8edb-50a3f18a994d.png\">https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68962290/209488799-912d0c5f-c379-4a98-8edb-50a3f18a994d.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68962290/209488799-912d0c5f-c379-4a98-8edb-50a3f18a994d.png\"><img src=\"/external_content/97ecb922237389cb02781ec9429464e6b3ac69a8/68747470733a2f2f757365722d696d616765732e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f36383936323239302f3230393438383739392d39313264306335662d633337392d346139382d386564622d3530613366313861393934642e706e67\"></a></div>",

In particular, we should disable specific buttons (not the entire compose area), and show a tooltip explaining why the button is disabled.</p>",
