So if the topic setting is in minutes, the default value is going to be a meaningless number to most (1440), and if the topic setting is in hours, you have two similar settings next to each other, one in minutes, and one in hours.</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/da/PuQVtddfn77G9Bfgexo4oGKr/pasted_image.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"pasted image\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/da/PuQVtddfn77G9Bfgexo4oGKr/pasted_image.png\"></a></div>",
