I believe that was Alya's point regarding 'if you want to combine it with keywords or other filters', which I attempted to clarify earlier too.</p>\n<p>My take on the top left corner is to be shortcuts to those most frequently-used filters - excepting recent conversations and drafts, which are different types of view.</p>\n<p>I've advocated in the past for a \"streams\" (ie. 'all my streams' in your words) shortcut/menu item/hotkey to parallel the private/direct message case. That already exists to a degree with the STREAMS title (eg. showing unreads), but previous discussion has erred away from cluttering the UI with eg. unreads for all stream messages there.</p>\n<p>In general, there's only so much space that's practical to use here, vertically, since for now this section is a fixed height and doesn't scroll.
