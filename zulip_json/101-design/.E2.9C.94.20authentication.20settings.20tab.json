We recently received a suggestion to improve the Authentication methods settings panel: <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/20987\">#20987</a>.</p>\n<p>I think at a minimum, it would make sense to make it look like our other checkbox settings -- checkboxes on the left, no horizontal lines.</p>\n<p>Thoughts on the cards/and or icons idea in the issue? I imagine this panel is not visited very frequently (one doesn't need to update these settings often), so I don't think it's worth investing a lot of time into.</p>",
