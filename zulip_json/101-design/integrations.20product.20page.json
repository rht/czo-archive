Though maybe that's what things look like on mobile (and not a big deal either way, given that people are unlikely to look at this much on mobile)</li>\n<li>Why does the whole categories list flash when you click on it (in the mobile view)?</li>\n</ul>",

So for example, <code>GitHub (webhook)</code> and <code>GitHub (services)</code> or something.</li>\n<li>When you click on a category, the integrations in that category materialize somewhat abruptly, would it be possible to have some kind of \"looming\" transition that's smoother and makes them appear a bit softly?
