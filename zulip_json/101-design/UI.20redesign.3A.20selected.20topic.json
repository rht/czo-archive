This allows to move from tinted blue hover color to have 2</li>\n<li>White background for the hover. Provides maximum contrast.</li>\n<li>No rectangles around counters allows to increase number size, increase horizontal space for the text. Right now counters grab too much of attention on a desktop. But if you don't trust my vision here and want to increase attention, we can do is to make them a bit darker/bolder.</li>\n<li>We still need to experiment with hiding counter number on hover, but if we don't like it I suggest to shift a number on hover to the left to free up space for the context button.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/a3/aEcLYHCvUOdR6cQ77LOo5iOz/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/a3/aEcLYHCvUOdR6cQ77LOo5iOz/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/a3/aEcLYHCvUOdR6cQ77LOo5iOz/image.png\"></a></div>",
