They need to be toned down and I feel the new design achieves this.</p>\n<p>2) Unread counts here in zulip are less akin to the images <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"58\">@Steve Howell</span> presented and more like something you might find in your email inbox ( See attached image ). This is because we are not funneling all notifications into one \"count\" rather these are more an aggregation of unread messages in different parts of the application. Therefore I don't feel they need to stick to unread count styling seen on app badges as referenced by some of you.</p>\n<p>3) I feel perhaps there might be an element of resistance to change at work here. I firmly believe in the design philosophy of experimentation and specially when it comes to design too much theorizing and not enough experimentation leads to stagnation.
