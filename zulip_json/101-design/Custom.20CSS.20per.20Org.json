It seems you've already changed it somewhat here (for the better).</p>\n<p>The problem I see with it is how prominent the box shadow is for something that I personally find not <em>that</em> important. In my opinion it should be a bit more subtle. So maybe a little dot next to the time or outline around it. Or a dot before the message to the left. Or a left-border. Maybe it could also be a bit more daring and use a different background color (say a light yellow).</p>",
