I think something like \"Everyone in the Zulip organization\", or \"Everyone in <code>**${realm.name}**</code>\", would be clearer. Possibly with \"including guests\" if we want to be explicit about that.</p>\n<p>So for example a set of options could be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[… all the more-specific groups …]</li>\n<li>Members of <code>**${realm.name}**</code> (not guests)</li>\n<li>Everyone in <code>**${realm.name}**</code>, including guests</li>\n<li>Everyone on the Internet</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think those labels feel pretty good as group descriptions to me.  I think we would probably still want shorter group names for those; maybe something like  <code>@members</code> / <code>@everyone</code> /  <code>@internet</code>, given those descriptions?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I guess a related thing we should discuss is whether we indeed want to add a \"group description\" field, and if so, how it should work.</p>",
