I was on mobile for my reply yesterday about this--the timing to do this right away is not perfect, but it's something somebody could start working on.  Our codepath for avatars is a bit more complicated than you'd think it would be, as we have lots of details like versions, avatar sizes, client capabilities to compute gravatar urls, live-updates for email changes, etc. that require somebody with a bit of knowledge to make this change.  And we may want the dust to settle a bit on some changes I've made recently.</p>",
