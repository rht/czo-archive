A few of the benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I feel like you currently need to understand the full Zulip model (including e.g. the blue box, and what a topic is) to grok our current buttons. The modal design gives us a bit more space to explain.</li>\n<li>Teaches x/c/r (possibly r should be Enter there)</li>\n<li>Reduces the chance of accidentally entering poweruser modes (e.g. opening stream compose while looking at a PM)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The main cost I think is that it makes creating a new topic feel more heavyweight, especially for mouse users. <br>\n(And creating a new group PM also goes from being 1 click to 2 click, but I think that's a rare enough action that it's not a big deal.)</p>",

I think there's room for an animation in our popover behavior, but I'd want to make sure it feels lightweight (figuring out the animation can be a separate effort from the current PR, though)</li>\n</ul>",
