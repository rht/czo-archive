As part of that, I'm using flexbox to present status emoji in the Direct Messages area. Coupled with a small refactor to the markup, and it's now possible to display status emoji next to a super-long username (here, Cordelia, who I've renamed \"Cordelia, Lear's daughter and superstar\"):</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/27/pcGHElca9O5wFTZtlb3GjlPO/Screenshot-2023-08-21-at-12.28.43-PM.png\">Screenshot-2023-08-21-at-12.28.43-PM.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/27/pcGHElca9O5wFTZtlb3GjlPO/Screenshot-2023-08-21-at-12.28.43-PM.png\" title=\"Screenshot-2023-08-21-at-12.28.43-PM.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/27/pcGHElca9O5wFTZtlb3GjlPO/Screenshot-2023-08-21-at-12.28.43-PM.png\"></a></div><p>The emoji itself is larger than what we currently present, but setting that to-do aside, I'm curious to hear opinions about the value of always presenting the status emoji in the DM list, even for super-long usernames.
