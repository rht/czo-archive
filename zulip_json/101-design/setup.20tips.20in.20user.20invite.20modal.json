It would probably be helpful to suggest these directly in the <code>INVITE USERS TO ZULIP</code> modal.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/b5/z1guVj_qIb9M1IdfH87PypST/Screen-Shot-2023-01-11-at-8.15.19-PM.png\">Screen-Shot-2023-01-11-at-8.15.19-PM.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/b5/z1guVj_qIb9M1IdfH87PypST/Screen-Shot-2023-01-11-at-8.15.19-PM.png\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2023-01-11-at-8.15.19-PM.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/b5/z1guVj_qIb9M1IdfH87PypST/Screen-Shot-2023-01-11-at-8.15.19-PM.png\"></a></div><p>The main steps in the documentation are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create your organization profile (see also <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"101\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/organization.20profile.20banner\">#design &gt; organization profile banner</a> )</li>\n<li>Customize organization settings -- looking over the settings, I think organization permissions would be the most pressing thing to highlight.</li>\n<li>Create streams</li>\n<li>Customize settings for new users<br>\n  a. Add custom profile fields, such as pronouns or job title.<br>\n  b. Configure default new user settings.<br>\n  c. Set default streams for new users.<br>\n  d. Set organization language for automated messages and invitation emails, if it should be something other than American English.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here are some thoughts on how we could incorporate these into the modal, with links to the appropriate settings panels throughout. Each of these would only be shown if the user has the permissions needed to take the relevant action.</p>\n<h2>At the top of the modal</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[for 1] If the org description and/or org profile picture has not been set:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You may want to configure your organization's login page prior to inviting users.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[for 4a, 4b]  Could show this only if the info above is not shown, to avoid dumping too many action items on the user at once. Could also be conditioned on (a) whether default new user settings have been changed, and (b) whether any custom profile fields have been added.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You may want to configure default new user settings and custom profile fields prior to inviting users.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Just above the \"Streams they should join\" section</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[for 3] If no streams have been created:<blockquote>\n<p>You may want to create streams prior to inviting users.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>",
