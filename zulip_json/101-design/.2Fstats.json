It is pretty cool, but I have a suggestion,  while I was looking at the Active users graph I was wondering about how the active users are being tracked, that is, if they've logged on one time during the day or if they've sent or read a message. It might be a good idea if we include a hover in the form of <code>i</code> or <code>?</code>, next to the <code>Active users</code> which tells about how do we track the active users, as it will be easier &amp; less time consuming for users or admin to know how analytics works rather than going through the documentation.</p>",
