And the Markdown parser should simply use a regex for ISO dates, which are recognizable enough that you don't need to wrap them in custom syntax. This makes the picker more discoverable and also lets you copy'n'paste ISO dates from elsewhere. I also think that we should render it with semantic Markup, HTML5 has a tag for time: <code>&lt;time datetime=\"2020-06-09T08:42:00+02:00\"&gt;Sat, Jun 20 2020, 8:50 AM&lt;/time&gt;</code>.</p>",
