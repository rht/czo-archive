The simplest models for doing this sort of thing would be to make the avatar be a function of something like a <code>(server_uri, user_id)</code> pair, or perhaps a <code>realm_uuid, user_id</code> pair (if we want it to be stable across domain changes), and that of course won't follow you to other hosting.</p>\n<p>Gravatar's origin is as a way to have the same avatar across a bunch of Wordpress blogs all over the Internet, and was created with that design constraint.</p>",

This has been true for 2-3 years. (It also will import most other personal preference settings). The thing that isn't great today is that if you decide to change your avatar, you have to upload it in each organization, which is annoying, but for a relatively infrequent task. This is a consequence of our decision to have accounts be per-organization, which is good for the security of corporate users (E.g. you can require SAML authentication to login to a specific organization) but results in this sort of inconvenience for non-corporate organizations.</li>\n<li>There's no simple way to share Zulip Cloud avatars with self-hosted organizations without some sort of security/privacy consequences.
