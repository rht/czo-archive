I am interesting to work for the visual design on Zulipâ€™s logged-out pages and <a href=\"http://zulip.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://zulip.org\">zulip.org</a> in general. I am not sure though if you are still interest for a project like these. Also I do not know what real open source contribution to do in this specific topic for Zulip so I could demostrate my work.</p>",
