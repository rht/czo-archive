But I have some concerns about moving private messages and mentions to the right sidebar that I think are worth talking about:<ul>\n<li>If the page is too narrow to fit both sidebars, right now the experience is pretty reasonable, because the left sidebar has everything important and needed to account for all the unread messages.  We'd need to think carefully about how to make the experience still feel good if we moved those to the right sidebar.  For that reason, I'd also not be excited about moving mentions and starred messages over.  I think a potentially valid approach would be in that responsive mode to try to fit both the sidebars' content in the left side, either with a tab switcher or with them stacked above each other.</li>\n<li>It's nice that one can catch up on all unread messages entirely looking at the left sidebar area, rather than having to look back and forth across the screen.  </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Rishi and I chatted a bit yesterday about Steve's idea of sorting unread streams in the left sidebar to the top, below pinned streams.  A concern that came up is that doing so could make it hard to find a stream you're looking for when scanning the list (if your immediate goal is to open that stream and send a message to it, not to catch up on unread messages).  Also, it would mean that the streams list re-sorts quite frequently when new messages come in, which might not look great and could be annoying when you're trying to click on a specific stream to have it potentially move on you.</li>\n</ul>",

I think it should be visually clear that these are different. Now the only difference is the the private messages start with 'You and...'  and a small difference in background color that is not even noticeable on many screens.   Some weeks ago I suggested moving the message-header to the right for private messages, but there might be other alternatives.</p>\n<p>A small improvement could be  to have the blue border of the  selected <code>messagebox</code> NOT on top of the left border that indicates the current Stream.   The stream-color is the main visual indicator, so it would be better if it was not interrupted. (i don't like that border at all, tbh)</p>\n<p>The <code>timerender</code> line should not interrupt the Stream . But someone was working on that iirc.</p>\n<p>Some messages have a green line on the left. The purpose  of it is not immediately clear (it took me a week). The color does not mix well with the Streams  colors. The mix of all the colors on the left/top of a message makes the page look unbalanced.</p>\n<p>The Stream title, topic and username are very close together, and have almost the same font. Especially with many short messages this grabs the attention away from the actual message text  . <a href=\"user_uploads/2/be/ZkI9884JLGhu6HQH7W_-YwHa/Screenshot-from-2018-12-07-13-18-32.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"user_uploads/2/be/ZkI9884JLGhu6HQH7W_-YwHa/Screenshot-from-2018-12-07-13-18-32.png\">Screenshot-from-2018-12-07-13-18-32.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"user_uploads/2/be/ZkI9884JLGhu6HQH7W_-YwHa/Screenshot-from-2018-12-07-13-18-32.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Screenshot-from-2018-12-07-13-18-32.png\"><img data-src-fullsize=\"/thumbnail?url=user_uploads%2F2%2Fbe%2FZkI9884JLGhu6HQH7W_-YwHa%2FScreenshot-from-2018-12-07-13-18-32.png&amp;size=full\" src=\"/thumbnail?url=user_uploads%2F2%2Fbe%2FZkI9884JLGhu6HQH7W_-YwHa%2FScreenshot-from-2018-12-07-13-18-32.png&amp;size=thumbnail\"></a></div>",
