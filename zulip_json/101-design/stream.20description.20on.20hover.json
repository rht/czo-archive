We could do this by using a popover with a template for stream descriptions: <a href=\"/user_uploads/2/62/qLhbzfzT7o3dvXrtMYiF4srH/pasted_image.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"pasted_image.png\">Style 1</a> or we could use a tool tip <a href=\"/user_uploads/2/ac/qUX0hiYHEeFHkD78K4YAF5sP/pasted_image.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"pasted_image.png\">Style 2</a> , we could have further styling for both options, I'd like feedback on which would be preferred. Also, in both these examples, I have it set so that the description is trimmed to about 80 characters (drops out last word and further if we go above that, I will make it add ellipses to the trimmed string later), is there any preferred character limit I should use?</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/62/qLhbzfzT7o3dvXrtMYiF4srH/pasted_image.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Style 1\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/62/qLhbzfzT7o3dvXrtMYiF4srH/pasted_image.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/ac/qUX0hiYHEeFHkD78K4YAF5sP/pasted_image.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Style 2\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/ac/qUX0hiYHEeFHkD78K4YAF5sP/pasted_image.png\"></a></div>",

If that's the case, we should just close the issue.
