I don't expect people will remember to check zulip though, so I want an easy thing everyone can do to get everything via email.</p>\n<p>The third use case is to respond to \"I hate all chat\" arguments against moving projects to zulip. I think it's a huge benefit of zulip that it does bridge nicely with email. (I think that's actually way more important than bridging nicely with IRC).
