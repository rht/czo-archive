Maybe we save the user from an extra mouse click or tap on the enter key. But we have a confusing experience where we literally sacrifice having a dialog with the user.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Interesting. I'm personally not too bothered about that so far, but I can see potential for improvement (especially for new and non-technical users) and you make a good point and I agree. I know we're getting off-topic, so maybe we can strike up the conversation somewhere else,  but what if instead of the composer box permanently hanging down the bottom there is a button that opens a dialog box (similar to composing an email) that provides contextual options for better work flow? It could increase some slight screen real estate (maybe), potentially lessen confusion about creating a new topic (or replying to the current one), and the great work that's been done to the editor re markdown toolbars/tooltips could all go in...</p>\n<p>Just thinking out loud... something like this... ?</p>\n<p>What SoGo looks like:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/4a/rSC67VKlosBh_9TaxA1PE0DN/Example-SoGo.gif\">Example-SoGo.gif</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/4a/rSC67VKlosBh_9TaxA1PE0DN/Example-SoGo.gif\" title=\"Example-SoGo.gif\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/4a/rSC67VKlosBh_9TaxA1PE0DN/Example-SoGo.gif\"></a></div><p>Brainstorm sketches... </p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/fb/B_4vvRbuDIrnspS7BOeqDVSO/Example-Zulip-ComposeButton.jpg\">Example-Zulip-ComposeButton.jpg</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/fb/B_4vvRbuDIrnspS7BOeqDVSO/Example-Zulip-ComposeButton.jpg\" title=\"Example-Zulip-ComposeButton.jpg\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/fb/B_4vvRbuDIrnspS7BOeqDVSO/Example-Zulip-ComposeButton.jpg\"></a></div><p><a href=\"user_uploads/2/39/lE9H7k2h7SZu_GBcjf-99h7Y/Example-Zulip-ComposeDialog.jpg\">Example-Zulip-ComposeDialog.jpg</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"user_uploads/2/39/lE9H7k2h7SZu_GBcjf-99h7Y/Example-Zulip-ComposeDialog.jpg\" title=\"Example-Zulip-ComposeDialog.jpg\"><img src=\"user_uploads/2/39/lE9H7k2h7SZu_GBcjf-99h7Y/Example-Zulip-ComposeDialog.jpg\"></a></div><p>PS if a moderator wants to move this post to a different topic, that's probably a good idea!</p>",
