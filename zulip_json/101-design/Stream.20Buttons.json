Most people here  would probably describe \"narrow\" as the list of messages in center or as the \"filter\" that defines which list of messages are being shown, so eg <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"101\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/101-design\">#design</a>  takes you to the design stream narrow.</p>\n<p>strange... I'm sure the concept of \"narrow\" was well explained in one of the doc pages but I can't seem to find a link to share here... maybe it was just a message on czo instead.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"11296\">@Siddharth</span>  I think the \"down arrow\" should be used only when a list of sub-options needs to be displayed. It also tells about a priority order i.e. first this (say stream name in left sidebar or icon for message actions in narrow) needs to be displayed then the underlying options. Incase for \"right arrow\", it should be used when it leads to a fresh content i.e. in the narrow irrespective of the position where it is getting displayed (left or right) wrt itself. I propose the right arrow can be used in right sidebar over a user name when hovered. Worth experimenting I feel. Also <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"9808\">@Yash RE</span> thanks for clarification!!</p>",
