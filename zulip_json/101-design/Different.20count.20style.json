I stand by having different styling for the starred counts (since they're not unread), but there might be some minor room for improvement here.  Perhaps we should at least have a hover for it that says something, although I don't really know what it would say.  Or just give it a little more unique styling.  The styling is somewhat delicate here, as you do want it to line up with the real unread counts (when you have mentions, for example).</p>",
