It's a good boy, it follows you around when you scroll, but it wags its tail too heavily in the process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Marking posts as read currently depends on the knursor's automatic tracking logic</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There's a lot of state to display, competing for real estate on the screen.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>The knursor which, even when the user doesn't use the arrow, shows what post they'll reply to</li>\n<li>Mouseover/hover state</li>\n<li>read/unread status</li>\n<li>messages with @mentions</li>\n<li>other ways to highlight messages</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here's my analysis</p>\n<p>A. Given how these features interact, the nut should be cracked holistically. Committing to e.g. the green line on the left without solving the rest is IMO premature.</p>\n<p>B. Keyboard nav and distraction-free reading are IMO not mutually exclusive, because you don't do them at the same time. Users will be either reading/replying, xor moderating/administrating.</p>\n<p>C. When reading, text is king. When scrolling with the mouse, the knursor should get out of the way, and the hover states should not trigger (the emoji/kebab/star should remain hidden). You may even want to hide the mouse cursor, some apps do that.</p>\n<p>C'. When navigating with the keyboard, though, having a distinctive knursor is important, and not distracting because the user is in control, so the movement is predictable.</p>\n<p>D. You can't entirely get rid of the knursor when reading, because it indicates visually the message and thus the topic one is replying to. So it would make sense to me to have the knursor minimized to the left (where the read/unread line lives). I'd rather have it where the green line is right now to put it as far as possible from the main text column.</p>\n<p>D'. Once minimized if the knursor fades in/out when it moves it will be even less obtrusive. </p>\n<p>E. The unread line could leave between the user picture and the text, or on the other side. (another option that IIRC hasn't been discussed would be to change the background color of the timestamp). Something that vanishes is, at least to me, less distracting than something that appears. Right now, with the channel border on the left, the green line is barely visible in dark mode anyway.</p>\n<p>F. The logic to automatically mark posts as read/unread should IMO be based around a timer that starts when the posts appear on screen. If they stay long enough, they're read (at least that would be a sane behavior for non-power users). You may add the option to use the knursor to mark things as read (posts remain unread until they are focused under the knursor).</p>\n<p>F'. Not sure what to do when a post is manually marked as unread... It should stay unread as long as it is visible on screen, but should it automatically me marked as read when they come back to it. I guess it would make sense...</p>\n<p>G. Not sure what to do with the other states at this point. The mouse hover state could slightly alter the background color, regardless of what it is. A pale, translucent grey <code>::before::</code> pseudo-element, below the text, <br>\n would work I think.</p>\n<p>Got to go now, I'll be AFK for ~4-5 hours</p>",

Specifically when I'm scrolling, it feels like the blue box is lagging behind if it falls out of view. It then plays 'catchup' and I'll see it scrolling back up at the bottom or top (depending on which direction I'm scrolling). Then if I reach the top of the thread and continue to scroll, it's like I'm scrolling the blue box up? I feel like that's inconsistent. </p>\n<p>As a keyboard user it works perfect, like the exact way I want it to. When I broke my wrist and had to use my computer by voice this is exactly the kind of feature that made apps accessible to me. But also apps like Discord or other alternatives wait until you do a keyboard navigation to show it. I especially like how Discord does things, where when they detect a keyboard navigation, they open a modal showing you how to use the keyboard navigation of the app (not the shortcuts, a modal explaining the tabbing, shift tabbing, and quick switcher).</p>",

Would also be good to use as much of the standard browser focus stuff as much as possible too if we're not already. Keyboard navigation is great, but tools like voice navigation tools or VoiceOver will use the browser focus to do stuff like skip between messages smartly or give users more info about what's highlighted. </p>\n<p>Also it would be nice to do contrast and low vision checks on it to make sure that folks with vision problems are still able to see it.</p>",
