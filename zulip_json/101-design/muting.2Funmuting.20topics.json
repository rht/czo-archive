I noticed some things that feel off about how muting topics from the recipient bar in the main window currently works.</p>\n<p>The way it works now:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Clicking on the bell w/ slash icon next to the topic name pops up a confirmation/undo box. It’s quite invasive, as pointed out in <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/2367\">#2367</a>. The box is the same regardless of whether the topic is muted or unmuted to begin with.</li>\n<li>Muting a topic greys it out in the left side bar, but there is no visual indication in the main window.</li>\n<li>The tooltip for hovering over the bell w/ slash icon says “Mute topic (m)” regardless of the current state.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Proposal for how it could work instead:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Get rid of the confirmation/undo pop-up altogether.</li>\n<li>Other than the confirmation, if the topic is currently unmuted, things look the same as now.</li>\n<li>If the topic is muted:<br>\n    1. The bell w/ slash icon is black by default.<br>\n    2. The tooltip for the icon says <code>Unmute topic (M)</code><br>\n    3. Clicking the bell unmutes the topic (cf. <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/15223\">#15223</a>) and changes the icon to the grey version.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thoughts?</p>",
