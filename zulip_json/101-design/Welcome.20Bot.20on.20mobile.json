I’ve done a pass of  going through the bot's responses, to see how they could be modified to work OK for mobile app users.</p>\n<p>I think the following messages are already OK: <code>apps</code>, <code>profile</code>, <code>message formatting</code>, <code>help</code>. The settings link in <code>profile</code> takes you to mobile web (where you have to separately log in), but that’s probably the best we can do for now.</p>\n<p>Here are proposals for discussion for the other messages: I’ve added pointers to what to do on mobile but otherwise did not modify these from the current version.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>theme</strong>: Go to <a href=\"http://localhost:9991/#settings/display-settings\">Display settings</a> to <a href=\"http://localhost:9991/help/dark-theme\">switch between the light and dark themes</a>, <a href=\"http://localhost:9991/help/emoji-and-emoticons#change-your-emoji-set\">pick your favorite emoji theme</a>, <a href=\"http://localhost:9991/help/change-your-language\">change your language</a>, and make other tweaks to your Zulip experience. You can customize your <a href=\"https://zulip.com/apps/\">mobile app</a> experience by clicking on your profile picture.</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>streams</strong>: In Zulip, streams <a href=\"http://localhost:9991/help/streams-and-topics\">determine who gets a message</a>. They are similar to channels in other chat apps.<br>\n<a href=\"http://localhost:9991/#streams/all\">Browse and subscribe to streams</a>, or click <code>#</code> and navigate to <strong>All streams</strong> in the mobile app.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>topics:</strong> In Zulip, topics <a href=\"http://localhost:9991/help/streams-and-topics\">tell you what a message is about</a>. They are light-weight subjects, very similar to the subject line of an email.<br>\n    Check out <a href=\"http://localhost:9991/#recent_topics\">Recent topics</a> to see what's happening, or click on the drawer icon in the mobile app! You can return to this conversation by clicking \"Private messages\" in the upper left, or the people icon on mobile.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Should we do anything about the fact that this instruction in the first message does not work in the mobile app?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I can also help you get set up! Just click anywhere on this message or press <code>r</code> to reply.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Is there a way we could include the actual mobile icons in the messages? (And if so, should we?)</p>\n</li>\n<li>What should we do with the <strong>keyboard shortucts</strong> message, none of which applies on mobile?<blockquote>\n<p>Zulip's <a href=\"http://localhost:9991/#keyboard-shortcuts\">keyboard shortcuts</a> let you navigate the app quickly and efficiently.<br>\nPress <code>?</code> any time to see a <a href=\"http://localhost:9991/#keyboard-shortcuts\">cheat sheet</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Separately, we should do a pass on the Help center to add mobile documentation on the pages we link to from Welcome Bot.</p>",
