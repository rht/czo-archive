I wanted to share an idea with you that I think could improve our experience on the platform.</p>\n<p>Currently, the profile features on Zulip are a bit hidden, so I thought it would be helpful to have a Profile button for quick access. With the Profile button, we would be able to easily view and manage our personal information and privacy settings. This would give us more control over our online presence and allow us to update our information as needed.</p>",
