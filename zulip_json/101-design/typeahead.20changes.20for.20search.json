I'm asking here how important these things are to fix, to see if we should prioritize some modifying (rewrite?) of typeahead before redesigning the search bar.</p>\n<p>PR is here: <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/24345\">#24345</a> -- development is complete except for changes from design review and code review.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It's possible for the typeahead to be open when the search box isn't in its expanded state, since the typeahead's state comes form focus on the search box instead of fully pairing with the search box. To fix this we'd need to change how typeahead keeps track of if it's open, or at least have an option for it to not open or close itself or something.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/8e/-2wmhOaTmInn-W-Yafaf2Fq4/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/8e/-2wmhOaTmInn-W-Yafaf2Fq4/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/8e/-2wmhOaTmInn-W-Yafaf2Fq4/image.png\"></a></div><ol start=\"2\">\n<li>For similar reasons, the typeahead closes briefly after the search bar closes, which means between expended and collapsed state it jiggers through such \"half width\" state (where the typeahead is open but not as wide as the full expanded search bar).</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/9c/2DJ2WMCbF3aaMv7oJtiF3U3C/243201989-61cf635f-f805-4b08-8bc8-b0749d72d85f.gif\">243201989-61cf635f-f805-4b08-8bc8-b0749d72d85f.gif</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/9c/2DJ2WMCbF3aaMv7oJtiF3U3C/243201989-61cf635f-f805-4b08-8bc8-b0749d72d85f.gif\" title=\"243201989-61cf635f-f805-4b08-8bc8-b0749d72d85f.gif\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/9c/2DJ2WMCbF3aaMv7oJtiF3U3C/243201989-61cf635f-f805-4b08-8bc8-b0749d72d85f.gif\"></a></div><ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Separately -- Vlad would like to highlight the search query in the search results, for example here \"de\" is bolded in the results</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/8/HR3CxbzwRE5lIFb9vtITKmxz/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/8/HR3CxbzwRE5lIFb9vtITKmxz/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/8/HR3CxbzwRE5lIFb9vtITKmxz/image.png\"></a></div><p>My guess is 1 and 2 need fixing, and 3 could be a bonus followup after the original redesign.
