Most of the mobile apps like facebook has updated to use round corner in most of the part of their apps. The drop shadow is sign of elevation, one of the key features of material design. So round corners + elevation + muted colors can be good design choice. Also one of the changes would be distinction between sidebars and main message container. Slack and Discord both has stream/channels column a different color while Zulip uses a same color for all of the columns.</p>",
