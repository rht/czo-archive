These hotspots would pulse until a user clicked on them, then disappear once the user had read the tip. <br>\nThe hotspots from the old onboarding experience are a nice way of providing users the contextual guidance they need in an unintrusive manner. They allow users to consume information when they are ready to rather than making it a prescriptive part of the experience.<br>\nTheir click rates, however, can be low. So when you have mission critical information that a user must know to be successful, sequential hotspots are the pattern of choice.</p>",
