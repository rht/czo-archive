So I am a bit in favor of using <code>ctrl+arrow keys</code> for switching images and only arrows keys for panning. Also, in case of <code>ctrl+arrow keys</code> for panning, if the user accidentally forgets to press the <code>ctrl</code> key with the arrow key, it will zoom out and change the image instantaneously (which IMO is a bad experience for user).</p>",
