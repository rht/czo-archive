Here's my personal reactions to them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Preview and Link icons aren't immediately recognizable to me as what they're supposed to be -- not sure I can readily express why.</li>\n<li>The eyes on the emoji icon feel hard to make out (they kinda disappear for me below a certain size); maybe they'd benefit from a few more pixels.  I think the <code>?</code> icon in the top-right shares this issue.</li>\n<li>The video call icon looks too square to me; maybe it could be less tall preserving the rest of the design?</li>\n<li>Is the person with a checkmark meant to be a poll?  It's not recognizable to me.  I guess the problem is that the natural icons for poll and TODO are very similar.  <a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-polls\">https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-polls</a> suggests Twitter uses a sideways bar graph for their polls icon; that might be a good direction since that's somewhat standard and we don't have a graphing feature it would compete with.</li>\n<li>The scroll icon, is also a bit mysterious, but I think that's probably fundamental to the fact that this isn't a standard icon for the concept.  I think it looks quite nice, and presumably you can get the label \"Spoiler\" via hover.</li>\n<li>The numbered/bulleted list icons feel hard to parse for me; the unordered list reminds me a bit of a dot next to a hamburger menu.  I think I'd be happier with a model similar to GitHub's where they have dots next to each line for <code>\\ul</code>, and 2 numbers for <code>\\ol</code>.</li>\n<li>The rest look good to me.</li>\n</ul>",

I'm less sure about the three buttons below, but we've been struggling with where to place them, so it could be a way out of that dilemma.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I think I like the design direction of moving the formatting/insertion buttons inside the compose box visually. The part that's not really working for me, is all the blank space above the \"send\" button. Would it be reasonable to make the compose box go all the way across, and put the \"send\" button alongside the compose buttons (outside of the scrollable area)?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I guess the \"To:\" is aligned with the compose placeholder text, but to me it feels too far to the right, especially if I'm not looking too closely.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Can you talk about the decision to make the compose box a bit wider? It's been growing on me, but I'm curious about the motivation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What are your thoughts on showing stream privacy icons in the compose box (which we currently do for non-public streams, and have thought about doing for public streams as well). It might seem funny/inconsistent to have a hash in the stream/PM switcher followed by a lock in the stream name area. But maybe it's OK? Switching the hash selector to a lock, etc., could also be an option.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Where would you place the <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"101\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/narrow.20to.20topic.2Fpms.20when.20composing\">#design &gt; narrow to topic/pms when composing</a>  button we plan to add?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I'm liking the grey background for the compose area, and the scrollable formatting buttons concept seems promising to me!</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",
