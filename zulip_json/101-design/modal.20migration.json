This comes with substantial visual design changes to our modals (faster animations, a more modern look, etc.) that we hope are an improvement, but have only been looked at by a few people, so visual feedback is very much encouraged!

        "content": "<p>There's kinda a few models that we've have for these, some of which are basically bugs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In most modals, we send the network request to the server to effect your change before closing the modal; I think this makes sense, since it produces a much more reasonable set of options should there be an error.</li>\n<li>Variant A, used in changing your email, clicking \"save\" in the modal immediately closes the modal, and then shows a \"Saving... Saved!\" indicator next to the button you clicked to open the \"Change your email address\" modal.  Here's an example from stream settings: <a href=\"/user_uploads/2/6b/89qzdTnJQ6PvSBFeqHalSBhO/image.png\">image.png</a>.  Errors are shown in that same spot.<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/6b/89qzdTnJQ6PvSBFeqHalSBhO/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/6b/89qzdTnJQ6PvSBFeqHalSBhO/image.png\"></a></div></li>\n<li>Note that Variant A is most similar to how our personal user settings work, where just clicking a checkbox does the \"Saving...saved\" animation by the section heading space, which should be within view when changing settings since we keep our sections short.  (And organization settings display a \"Save / discard\" widget instead, to make accidental changes harder)</li>\n<li>There are still details to think about when leaving the modal open while applying your change.  </li>\n<li>Variant B is changing the \"Save\" button into a loading spinner, which is nice because it prevents double-clicking the save button.  These typically will show any error in a new line at the top or bottom of the modal.  I think the best pattern would be on the line directly above the \"Save\" button, because otherwise it's possible in a tall modal for the error to be scrolled offscreen from what you're looking at.  I believe the left sidebar \"Move topic\" modal is an example of this design.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Variant C is showing a \"Saving...Saved\" widget somewhere on the modal itself, in whatever position an error message would appear should the action fail.  E.g. the \"Change email\" modal puts this in the title area, which is OK as long as the error message isn't too long:<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/f1/dN63BAvZqJnlHzjMVBDyt8zZ/image.png\">image.png</a>.  </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/f1/dN63BAvZqJnlHzjMVBDyt8zZ/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/f1/dN63BAvZqJnlHzjMVBDyt8zZ/image.png\"></a></div></li>\n<li>\n<p>In variants B and C, there's a question of what to do should the action succeed.  My preference is to just close the modal rather than waiting to display some sort of \"Saved!\" final result long enough for the user to do, since doing so kinda wastes the user's time if they're doing several changes in a row.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
