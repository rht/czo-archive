I think about 60% of the screens have basically the same shape--some <code>list_render</code> widget plus some UI to add/upload stuff.  So somebody who wants to focus on settings can repeat the same sort of holistic audit that we did--it really only took about four hours of pretty intense conversation--and then have a roadmap where they can prioritize from either easiest-to-fix to hardest-to-fix or fix-most-egregious-problems-to-fix-most-subtle-problems.</p>",
