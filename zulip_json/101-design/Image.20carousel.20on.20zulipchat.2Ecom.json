But we’re in a rebranding effort that’s in progress but still in early planning stages. It’s possible, maybe even likely, we’ll be using a different approach in the near future for the homepage. So I’m not inclined to put a whole lot of energy into fixing this if it is going to be changed in the near future anyway.</p>\n<p>My longterm plan is to communicate what’s in the carousel with a short animated video in the near feature. As well as focus on the benefits of Zulip without necessarily naming our competitors.</p>\n<p>Perhaps a better discussion to have is what would be a better way to communicate this information than what we have now? How can we quickly tell others how Zulip is an effective more productive communication tool that can create value for them?</p>\n<p>My thoughts are pivoting to something that is mobile first in design principles, looks great on mobile, and desktops. I like the simplicity of what one of our competitors <a href=\"https://rocket.chat\">https://rocket.chat</a> has done as an example. </p>\n<p>Really want to optimize for new signups, and free trials for Zulip Cloud, as well as clearly communicate the benefits of Zulip vs. comparing it to other solutions. Not sure a carousel is necessary (but ultimately a decision hasn’t been made yet to not have a carousel). I also want to build a series of several different landing pages targeting different audiences with slight tone and design variations for different audiences.</p>\n<p>I really love the under water theme of the Zulip website, and actually want to nudge it a step further. Visually, I think we can do something graphically pleasing while still keeping the same simplicity. My intention is to keep a similar color scheme to what we have now but maybe a tad bit more blue like our recent ad campaign (the colors are currently used on our site anyway but not uniformly).</p>\n<p>Do you have any thoughts on how we can improve our homepage design overall? What should we consider during our rebrand?</p>",
