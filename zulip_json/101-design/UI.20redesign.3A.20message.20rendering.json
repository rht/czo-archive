I think my reasoning is that the numbering is that we generally use grey colors for components that we expect the user to visually filter out / ignore, and I think the bullets (or numbering) in a message is conceptually first-class information in the message that one wants to read (And to the extent that numbered lists are used, it's usually with intent to use the numbering in discussion, e.g. someone might say \"Regarding point 2, ...\").</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/7e/7L6TkKTP8Pclnzh3-b_sWL7A/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/7e/7L6TkKTP8Pclnzh3-b_sWL7A/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/7e/7L6TkKTP8Pclnzh3-b_sWL7A/image.png\"></a></div>",

        "content": "<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I notice that there's increased line spacing between different messages by the same sender. Is there a similarly increased spacing between paragraph in a single multi-paragraph message? We have in the past had the goal of having those two vertical spacings be essentially identical, because it reduces stress when sending a long series of thoughts -- you can split up a long series of thoughts into multiple messages or do them as a single message and both will look visually nice to users. For context, there was a while when we observed users doing all sorts of message editing workarounds (E.g. copying content from follow-up messages into extra paragraphs in the first one and then deleting the now duplicate second message) in order to get reasonable paragraph spacing in a chain posting. </p>\n<p><a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"6\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/6-frontend/topic/recipient.20row.20livestream\">#frontend &gt; recipient row livestream</a> is a good example of the type of content where one has a nice reading experience that benefits from follow-up messages being the same height as paragraph breaks.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
