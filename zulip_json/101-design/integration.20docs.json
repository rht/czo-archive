Fwiw I find the integration docs to have a bit of a \"wall of text\" vibe, which makes it hard to follow (not just the Sentry integration docs); but I'm not a designer myself so I don't have any concrete suggestions on that front.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The exact page the user is talking about is <a href=\"https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/sentry\">this</a>. The layout is pretty much similar to other integrations.</p>\n<p>I think the layout looks fine -- maybe that's how the docs are. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"22433\">@Vlad Korobov</span> you got anything to say on this one.</p>",

There, set the <strong>Webhook URL</strong> to the URL you constructed in the above step then enable <strong>Alert Rule Action</strong>. You can fill out the remaining details as you like. If you want notifications for issues and not just events, you can scroll down to <strong>Webhooks</strong> on the same page and check the box that says <strong>issue</strong>. Make sure that you set up the permissions so that the integration will be visible to the right people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's at least four steps, on a generously coarse counting. Nine steps, on a finer-grained count. It should be broken out in the form of a list, not run together as one paragraph.</p>",
