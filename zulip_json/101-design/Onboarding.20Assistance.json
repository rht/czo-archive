For example, we could set certain conditions in order for a tip to be displayed -<br>\nIf a user just started using the app we could stagger the tips in a smart way. Like maybe show them 1 or at most 2 tips at the very beginning and then slowly introducing increasingly advanced features over time. </p>\n<p>I've been using a couple of apps that do this and its actually really nice because it doesn't feel like you're bombarded with hints at the very beginning and also gives you time to get to grips with the UI before introducing more advanced ideas.</p>",
