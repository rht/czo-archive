Few ideas I had in mind are:-</p>\n<p>Since the notification settings are basically booleans, I was thinking of adding a cross button, clicking it would mean accepting the global settings for that notification and that stream would get removed.</p>\n<p>Also, for organisations with many streams listing many unmatched streams for would be a problem. So we could reuse the popup button beside <code>New stream notifications:</code> text in the <code>#organization/organization-settings</code> page and maybe add the cross button beside each unmatched stream.<br>\nThis would be done for all the 5 stream message notification settings. </p>\n<p>I also had a question about where to place the unmatched notification lines:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>below the <code>Change notification settings for individual streams on your Streams page.</code> line that is under the global settings.</li>\n<li>or at the end of the page where slack puts it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also we could just place the stream exceptions buttons beside each checkbox lines. But it seems there are plans to change the layout of the checkboxes on notifications tab to a grid structure (<a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/12182\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/12182\">#12182</a>).</p>\n<p>Added the GIF for how <code>slack</code> does it for reference.....<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/fc/EKEe8qAG0stY80T_ATRSNQnD/slack_notifications.gif\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"slack_notifications.gif\">slack_notifications.gif</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/fc/EKEe8qAG0stY80T_ATRSNQnD/slack_notifications.gif\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"slack_notifications.gif\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/fc/EKEe8qAG0stY80T_ATRSNQnD/slack_notifications.gif\"></a></div>",
