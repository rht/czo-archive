Partly because it is hard to implement correctly in all cases... but well that is just code.<br>\nI don't think Slack or Zulip does it correctly anyway. It is like 50/50 chances that you will see currently active item in the side bar and this is just not relishable. </p>\n<p>Good navigation should show where you at in the context of some hierarchy not just \"you are where you are\".<br>\nSo I think instead we should highlight folded parent group as selected but don't show selected item outside such group.</p>\n<p>You are talking to Vlad and folded DMs? Ok let us highlight that you are in DMs<br>\nYou are in topic X but folded the whole stream group? Ok let us highlight that you are in this stream group. And if you over scrolled that folded group in the left side bar we don't show you anything.. we could later make a little line stick to top or bottom like apple calendar does.</p>\n<p>If we want a feature which will navigate, expand and highlight exact location of a menu item inside the menu we should do that feature and it could initially be behind more button of the recipient bar. Later we could make a click to currently active view header to do that.</p>",
