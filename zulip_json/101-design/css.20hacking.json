So, by accident, you get this somewhat amusing view of what Zulip would look like without any color styling.

For example, some 'disabled' color can be <code>rgba(127, 127, 127, 0.75)</code> thus on the light theme be lighter and on the dark theme darker than the mid-gray that 127x3 suggests.</p>",
