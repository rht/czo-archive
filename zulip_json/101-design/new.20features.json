The whole point of Zulip is structured conversation. But in a company there is a lot of communication going on that has only temporary relevance and there is just as much stuff that needs to be kept (in a stream). Other option would be to be able to convert a private group chat msg into a stream msg to transfer it. A conversation that started private and trivial leads into ideas relevant for others. Rather than copying the content into the stream, it can be moved to the stream (ie. option under chevron). But it's not a high priority thing...</p>",
