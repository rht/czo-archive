The right side of the stream config has bit of a vertical scroll and the subscriber list within that right panel has a vertical scroll. That's bad.<br>\nApart from this, as we add more and more stream specific features. It's only going to get worse. I wanted to push for stream specific default markdown languages and hesitated because I thought: \"we might not have space for this setting\". Which is bad.</p>",
