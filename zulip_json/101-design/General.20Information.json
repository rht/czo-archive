But, I'm still opinionated that having things being fetched/over-ridden via the Django template engine (separately with <strong>Handlebars</strong> ) somewhat complicates the task of a front end designer/developer since they have to take care of backend code as well.  Having shifted the <a href=\"http://Zulipchat.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://Zulipchat.org\">Zulipchat.org</a> on a node server would have made it easy for them (also accommodating to the dynamic capabilities like : \"features like showing if the user is already logged in\" -- among other things).</p>",

Most things that frontend developers end up changing tend to live in handlebars templates now, actually.  The server only provides the \"skeleton\" of the page, essentially, although there are some exceptions to that.</p>",
