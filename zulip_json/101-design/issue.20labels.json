So you might assign it in many cases, but not, e.g., if the issue needs some feedback from me, or is difficult and likely needs to be taken on by a core team member.</li>\n<li>\"Release goal\" means that something is specifically a goal for the 6.0 release (see <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"2\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/2-general/topic/Zulip.206.2E0.20release.20plan\">#general &gt; Zulip 6.0 release plan</a> ). <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"7\">Tim Abbott</span> and I will add that label if appropriate; many redesign issues will be high-priority but not specifically release goals.</li>\n</ol>",
