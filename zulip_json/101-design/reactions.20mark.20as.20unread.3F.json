There's a user problem where sometimes you're waiting for a response on some message (e.g. an approval of some proposal), and there's no good way to notice that you got a response if it comes in the form of an emoji reaction (e.g. a thumbs up).</p>\n<p>A possible solution is to mark your own message as unread when it receives a reaction.
