It would be reasonable to have \"I agree with this comment\" emoji for an <code>=</code> keyboard shortcut. I think <span aria-label=\"100\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f4af\" role=\"img\" title=\"100\">:100:</span> is the standard emoji that's probably most similar in meaning? But at least to me, <span aria-label=\"100\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f4af\" role=\"img\" title=\"100\">:100:</span> has a kinda intense tone that I'm not sure is totally ideal for a \"This is what I would have said\" use case. (That could be just in my head!)</p>",
