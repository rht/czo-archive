This adds presence circles for the suggested users that in typeahed.<br>\nTo add this there were some pretty minor but important tweaks with how users/(user groups) suggestions are aligned in the typeahead.  It would be nice to have some feedback about these changes or any other issues that might be related to this context. Here are some screenshots of the changed typeahead.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/6f/nq-DvJbqzhKFNZWfo7JDuTtw/image.png\">image.png</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/6f/nq-DvJbqzhKFNZWfo7JDuTtw/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/6f/nq-DvJbqzhKFNZWfo7JDuTtw/image.png\"></a></div><p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/1d/f-XSYdwShIDr2X9B9VifwyLa/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/1d/f-XSYdwShIDr2X9B9VifwyLa/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/1d/f-XSYdwShIDr2X9B9VifwyLa/image.png\"></a></div>",
