I feel like there needs to be parity between the icons and the messages associated with them. If that means merging the orange half-filled-in icon with the empty dot icon as well as introducing a new one for those users that have a custom status that might be a good idea.</p>\n<p>2) I agree with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"4922\">@Abhigyan Khaund</span> that it would be a nice to have a setting to be able to toggle seeing a user's status without hover. I understand this could be noisy for a lot of people so a toggle would be nice for that.</p>\n<p>3) I would instinctively look to be able to set my status from the UI Settings area.
