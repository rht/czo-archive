Often, streams are created for  the conference sessions, in which case a chronological order is better suited than an alphabetical one.

Being able to control the order via the API would be nice.<br>\n<a href=\"user_uploads/2/65/4Y9lsKCErIbiWpa-GNw_uIaP/Screenshot_2021-06-03-Virtual-platform.png\">Screenshot_2021-06-03-Virtual-platform.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"user_uploads/2/65/4Y9lsKCErIbiWpa-GNw_uIaP/Screenshot_2021-06-03-Virtual-platform.png\" title=\"Screenshot_2021-06-03-Virtual-platform.png\"><img src=\"user_uploads/2/65/4Y9lsKCErIbiWpa-GNw_uIaP/Screenshot_2021-06-03-Virtual-platform.png\"></a></div>",

This is definitely a case for wanting the organization to control the ordering, not the end user, so that's helpful to think about, since I could imagine a user-centered design here instead.  (I suppose you could replace the unicode characters with a number encoding the date, but that doesn't feel super clean either).</p>",
