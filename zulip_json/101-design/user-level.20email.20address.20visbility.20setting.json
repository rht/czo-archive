The current PR is <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/20102\">#20102</a>.</p>\n<p>As after adding different users could have different setting, there can be case when email address of some users will be available while emails of some will not be available. And there are multiple places where we show email for a list of users like Users list in Organization settings, subscriber list in stream settings overlay, etc. Since there can be case of emails of all users not being available, it was discussed to show user IDs instead of emails for those users.</p>\n<p>I have currently implemented the below in the PR, which does not look that nice -<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/e4/1395VAyBYDiVTWZvdHcbBpr5/Screenshot-from-2021-10-30-00-45-56.png\">Screenshot-from-2021-10-30-00-45-56.png</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/e4/1395VAyBYDiVTWZvdHcbBpr5/Screenshot-from-2021-10-30-00-45-56.png\" title=\"Screenshot-from-2021-10-30-00-45-56.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/e4/1395VAyBYDiVTWZvdHcbBpr5/Screenshot-from-2021-10-30-00-45-56.png\"></a></div><p>One suggestion was to add a copy button along with ID -<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/c2/686BhIBTCn5adSJiCUPWeS5g/Screenshot-from-2021-11-01-17-07-27.png\">Screenshot-from-2021-11-01-17-07-27.png</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/c2/686BhIBTCn5adSJiCUPWeS5g/Screenshot-from-2021-11-01-17-07-27.png\" title=\"Screenshot-from-2021-11-01-17-07-27.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/c2/686BhIBTCn5adSJiCUPWeS5g/Screenshot-from-2021-11-01-17-07-27.png\"></a></div><p>Would love to hear feedback/suggestions.</p>",
