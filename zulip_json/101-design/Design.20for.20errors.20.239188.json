From above comment, my understanding here is that we want to show errors for each subsection in the corresponding block rather than on top of the page. If this is right, how we want to present this error i.e. in a button, any bootstrap element or else.</p>\n<p>And for the ideal case mentioned I think it is not possible to implement it because we don't get information that on changing which property we got the error. (The solution here will be to do again a complete restructure of settings and implement something like what slack have implemented i.e. save each setting individually).</p>",
