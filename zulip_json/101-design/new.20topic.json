It has passed all the tests and I have also tested it manually. Please have a look in your free time. In a nutshell:<br>\n1. You can now click on intro_compose irrespective of whether you have seen other hotspots or not.<br>\n2. The tests had to be modified as earlier only one hotspot was sent when initialized but now two of them are sent, namely 'intro_compose' and 'intro_reply'.<br>\n3. Once you have seen the hotspot intro_compose, the on-focus event will unbind itself. So next time it won't pop up again.<br>\n4. Clicking on intro_compose okay button does not call next_hotspot. It is abstracted from other hotspots. Had this been enabled, a specific bug arises which causes re-rendering of the hotspot yet to be seen but has been rendered already.<br>\nThanks!</p>",
