(The \"All messages\" total will be more important in lower-traffic communities). I've seen other products, like Discord, that do a \"More unread above/below\" thing in their sidebar, and if you've got a moderate number of unreads, it kinda feels useless, because it's always there. Possibly there's a tweak on it that could address it -- like if \"12 unread private messages\" fit?

There'd be an \"OTHER STREAMS\" section at the bottom if you have at least one stream group and not every stream is in a stream group. (I think stream groups would not be hard to start adding -- a base version would be just a data model and a dropdown in \"Manage streams\" for which group something is in, and we very much want them for permissions model reasons eventually).</li>\n<li>Pinned streams become pinned only within their stream group. This is probably less convenient if you want to have a single place for all the streams you care about across the organization, but is likely more convenient in other settings. (Not an actual change until organizations actually have stream groups).</li>\n<li>We're basically going to lose the global \"filter streams\" widget for organization using stream groups; instead you'll be only able to filter streams within a group, mainly because it's really not clear where to put a filter box otherwise.

A few notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I think I like the new 3-dots icon for a group DM; I kinda feel like I'm wanting similar 4-dots/5-dots groups for large groups, as it's kinda helpful to visually see how big those groups are at a glance as it's a lot easier as a reference than reading the list of names ... we could also think about a different design that involved a number.</li>\n<li>All messages I think should have the unread count dropped -- we're moving the count that would make sense for it to Inbox. I don't think there's any count that will make sense to attach to that view.</li>\n<li>The Drafts count should probably match the starred/scheduled counts -- they're not unread messages, but instead more like those other things.</li>\n<li>We use Simplebar for scrollbars in widgets across the app because native Linux/Windows scrollbars are very bulky/ugly in that sort of setting, and also just have different geometry from Mac scrollbars (as they take up space differently), so I think we'll definitely want to use that here as well. (Our motivation for using it is primarily consistency across platforms/browsers, as you guessed).</li>\n<li>It looks like the left edge of the names of DM conversations is slightly horizontally misaligned with those for streams/topics; I think it'd be better for them to be aligned vertically, such that there's basically a column for \"left sidebar clickable views\"?</li>\n<li>I like the <code>{</code> grouping the topics in the stream. In the screenshot, I was a bit worried that the topic names won't stand out enough from stream names given identical font, vertical spacing, and horizontal alignment... but in the demo, the background highlighting for the active stream makes that not feel like a concern: <a href=\"/user_uploads/2/ed/9HbgsCRnYBICpMYHIQctlAmN/image.png\">image.png</a><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/ed/9HbgsCRnYBICpMYHIQctlAmN/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/ed/9HbgsCRnYBICpMYHIQctlAmN/image.png\"></a></div></li>\n</ul>",

For \"BROWSE 135 MORE STREAMS MAIN\", I think it can be just \"BROWSE 135 MORE STREAMS\" -- no need to name the stream group</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sure. I used long names in some buttons just to test and show that layout is working the way we want in extreme cases.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The heading in \"more topics\" for a given stream of \"STREAM TOPICS\" doesn't feel right... Maybe just \"ALL TOPICS\" would be OK? We could also think about renaming the button to get here to \"ALL TOPICS\" as well... I checked the code and it is in fact every topic that exists in the stream that you can access. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wow, thanks. I thought about it and tried but then in some conversations with Alya we weren't sure that we actually have all topics. Great, I'll rename to ALL TOPICS</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don't feel the need to have a title row for the overlay at all. (We'd have to figure out how to place the X, but pushing the vdots in a bit might work)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you hit MORE DM CONVERSATIONS you can see that case: <a href=\"/user_uploads/2/8d/um3MQ2cc-IeRjjpYP8KYrgeY/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/8d/um3MQ2cc-IeRjjpYP8KYrgeY/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/8d/um3MQ2cc-IeRjjpYP8KYrgeY/image.png\"></a></div><p>I'm not fan of that layout, but don't have anything better in mind. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think we should cut the \"Add a stream\" button at the bottom. It's a pretty active button -- not as loud as \"Send\" but louder than the reply buttons. And it's redundant -- \"Browser N more streams\" seems like an intuitive place (and if you're on every stream, that already says \"Create a stream\"). </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In general we have control of loudness of visual expression of buttons but I agree with you for the solution of having Create when you see all streams and hide that button in 3-dot when there is ALL TOPICS</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What feature the \"MORE STREAMS DEVELOPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is just a test of long stupid names that I hope will not be in the UI. I tested word-wrapping for those buttons....</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don't love the \"interleaved view\" icon has a rightwards-pointing trapezoid shape</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I will propose an alternative. For me it was <code>OK, I'm ready to go all in on this thing and be brave</code>. The challenge is to make it not like \"left aligned text\" icon</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The purple background part of the hover state over \\vdots feels really high emphasis for something your mouse might drift over.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I disagree. It is important button which is hidden by default.  3 dots are small, so we do need significant background change to indicate that you hovered on a button inside currently hovered item (think regular people). I suggest to live with this color and later we could dim it a bit. But  we should definitely highlight the whole hit area.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also is it intended that the hover/click area is extra tall for wider messages? I think it could be intended, but would generally prefer just the box around the icon itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tall messages have the full height more button, because it would be strange if you slide it and in some place button isn't working anymore. This right place in 95% cases is  a button and making some 5% cases not a button felt strange. <br>\nIts not a problem to make it fixed height but why not have a big button for a big list item?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don't like the \"shrink on click\" animation for the sidebars; having the side icons, text, and unread counts all move inwards on click feels like it draws your attention</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We should distinguish click on item vs click on more button vs potentially click on another button in a list item. It is unusual to have click area which isn't fully a button. In physical world buttons can be pressed. I tried background change and it all felt wrong (unnecessary blinking which attracts more attention). <br>\nBut Animations could be annoying and tuning them requires precision. It is a bit hard with css scale property, but let me tune that and minimize that effect. <br>\nIn general there is nothing bad to indicate to a person what exactly they clicked.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So I propose dropping the \"shrink on click\" animation</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I feel like it adds good feeling and allows to have not so distinctive background changes... or no background changes at all.<br>\nIt is expressive and gives a good feedback. I think it makes UI a bit more accessible - user can clearly see what was clicked. <br>\nIn a loaded interfaces like Zulip it is important. Buttons are almost everywhere here and they are not big usually.</p>\n<p>Turning off css scale property is pretty easy, so I suggest to try to live with it and ask people.  Current message buttons have a scale effect and I for now I don't hear people say \"can I turn off this animation to avoid motion sickness?\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>but I think we need a bit bigger background around the number in the 10 case,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Number 10 is inside 16px circle, as any other icon here is 16px rect. I can make this circle bigger that 16px like this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/3d/sCBl7-l8ow0FZYPtcmVRprUk/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/3d/sCBl7-l8ow0FZYPtcmVRprUk/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/3d/sCBl7-l8ow0FZYPtcmVRprUk/image.png\"></a></div><p>So it visually feels same size</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But I think the way the hover interaction with \"more topics\" at the bottom doesn't look great. I think a good solution would be for the bottom of the brace to only go as far right as the top does -- the brace will be more symmetric and I think it'll fix this interaction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is funny that I did struggle to add it <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span>.

And I wish sidebar would be resizable. I didn't make it significantly bigger just to test min width...<br>\nSidebar width is 1 css variable, so we can tune it.
