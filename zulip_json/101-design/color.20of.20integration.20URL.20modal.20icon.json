It will be accessible from the <code>Bots</code> tab in <code>Personal Settings</code>. For that, an icon is to be added -- most probably it would be <a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/v4/icon/link\">fa-link</a>. </p>\n<p>I am confused about what color should be used for the icon. I think \"Steel Blue\" <code>hsl(207, 44%, 49%)</code> might be a good choice. But would love to hear if something else can be used.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/42/wjcX4yayioFZIxqKwZY3owR-/image.png\">Light Theme</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/42/wjcX4yayioFZIxqKwZY3owR-/image.png\" title=\"Light Theme\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/42/wjcX4yayioFZIxqKwZY3owR-/image.png\"></a></div><p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/e4/Jm_2kXYqHIcbm0ldQ4iOIxMJ/image.png\">Dark Theme</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/e4/Jm_2kXYqHIcbm0ldQ4iOIxMJ/image.png\" title=\"Dark Theme\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/e4/Jm_2kXYqHIcbm0ldQ4iOIxMJ/image.png\"></a></div>",
