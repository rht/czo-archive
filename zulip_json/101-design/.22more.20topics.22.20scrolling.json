I've found this kind of unintuitive and found myself stumbling around to figure  out where did the button go and how to get back to the normal list of streams until figuring out i need to scroll back up. I think that possibly the scrolling should be just through the topics list and <code>Back to streams</code> (and possibly the stream name + \"filter topics\" search box) should be an independent element that stays on top?</p>",
