I started thinking about it in the context of the link color discussion on <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/12321\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/12321\">#12321</a>.</p>\n<p>Every other product I can think of has a white settings page (even gmail, which used to have a lightly colored one). One benefit of us matching that pattern are that button colors, link colors, etc don't have to be redesigned just for the settings page. Also I think white will look more modern.</p>",
