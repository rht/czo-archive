We are close to being able to merge the backend for setting custom expiration periods for invitations (links and emails), so I'm kicking off this thread to discuss what exactly the front end should look like. I recently had a professor reach out to me about this feature, and it also might have helped avoid <a href=\"#narrow/stream/60-twitter/topic/zulip/near/1251315\">this tweet</a>.</p>\n<p>The issue we have for this is <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/16407\">#16407</a>.</p>\n<p>The Organization Settings &gt; Invitations UI proposed in the issue looks fine to me:<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/a4/Lmhrph8vbjNtGwFWRmnRzQn0/image.png\">image.png</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/a4/Lmhrph8vbjNtGwFWRmnRzQn0/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/a4/Lmhrph8vbjNtGwFWRmnRzQn0/image.png\"></a></div><p>I'm curious what folks think about the UI for setting the expiration time, which in <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/16407\">#16407</a> is:<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/18/nZK8aAk6EmUCW1PDNAvco9ym/image.png\">image.png</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/18/nZK8aAk6EmUCW1PDNAvco9ym/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/18/nZK8aAk6EmUCW1PDNAvco9ym/image.png\"></a></div><p>Both Slack and Discord offer a drop-down rather than asking the user to put in an arbitrary number of days, which I'm not sure how I feel about. It does make it possible to put \"Never\" as one of the options, and to have expiration periods shorter than one day.</p>",
