We should also<br>\nmodify changes to other systems that user groups interact with. Details<br>\ndiscussed below, where the related fields are parenthesized:</p>\n<h2>Group-group memberships (<code>direct_subgroups</code>/<code>direct_supergroups</code>)</h2>\n<p>When deactivated, the deactivated group should be removed from existing<br>\ngroup-group memberships. Or, to keep the memberships, we just skip deactivated<br>\nuser groups in recursive queries. This will disable the DAG constraint check,<br>\nso we must re-check the constraints when reactivating the user group. The<br>\ndownside is that it is harder to give an actionable error message when<br>\nreactivation fails due to discovered cycles.</p>\n<h2>Group based settings (<code>can_mention_group</code>/<code>can_remove_subscribers_group</code>)</h2>\n<p>When deactivated, <code>can_mention_group</code>, <code>can_remove_subscribers_group</code>, etc. need to<br>\nbe reassigned to another group before deactivation. In the UI, we can<br>\npotentially prompt the user to set them back to the defaults either through a<br>\nseparate request or a flag to the deactivation endpoint.</p>\n<h2>Audit logs (<code>modified_user_group</code>)</h2>\n<p>Audit logs should be unaffected. We record <code>USER_GROUP_DEACTIVATION</code> and<br>\n<code>USER_GROUP_REACTIVATION</code> events.</p>\n<h2>Mentions (<code>mentioned_user_group</code>)</h2>\n<p>Modify <code>MentionData</code> so that deactivated user groups are not included.<br>\nWe can do something similar to extracting <code>get_linkable_streams</code> and have<br>\n<code>get_linkable_user_groups</code>.</p>\n<p>I'm not too sure about the handling of missed messages for this one. Should we<br>\nskip notifications for deactivated user groups? When should the check happen?</p>\n<h2>Questions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Should we allow deactivating system groups?</li>\n<li>Should changes to other fields, including name, description, and direct members be allowed?</li>\n<li>How should deactivation interact with user group mentions in messages?</li>\n<li>What are some other use cases of UserGroup that might be affected?</li>\n</ul>",
