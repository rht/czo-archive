The current logic calls a function that's used in the navbar to describe the current view, which can be any combination of operators. (And we've put considerable effort into to trying to not have 6 semi-duplicates versions of that). So while it's of course possible to have overrides for specific cases, it may get messy fairly quickly. Though I think most complex views will end up being cut off due to length, there's probably 15+ single-operator views that one can describe, like \"topics marked as resolved\" or \"messages containing images\".</p>\n<p>If we're just trying to only do this second line for a handful of specific types of views in this widget (e.g. just the stream narrows and \"all private messages\" narrow), then that's not a consideration.</p>",

This means (1) the message you're composing would appear in the current view and (2) the current view is a stream narrow, all-private-messages narrow, or all-messages narrow. The last two could be potentially confusing if all the messages on screen are in the conversation in question (E.g. all of your last 20 messages are PMs with a single individual).</li>\n<li>We do not display a second line in other situations.</li>\n<li>We avoid displaying the stream name, since that's hard to style, so the messages are, e.g., \"Currently viewing the entire stream.\" or \"Currently viewing all private messages.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This avoids all the complexity (and bugs!) with trying to provide descriptions for situations where this button's appearance won't be confusing in the first place, like if you're composing a private message while viewing a search view for messages in public streams containing the word \"turtle\".
