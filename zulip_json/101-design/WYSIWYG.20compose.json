Some suggested simplification look strange personally to me but for others might be \"lower barrier of entrance in Zulip\". <br>\nFor example pasting lists. I think its very easy to type <code>-</code> or <code>1.</code> in the message but there are users who would prefer UI for that (<a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/20305\">issue</a>). I thought of a strategic way to address this problem with 2 different kinds of users. And I'm not asking to decide on that, but just want to share an idea.<br>\nThe preview icon could be a switch between <code>source code editing</code> and <code>WYSIWYG mode</code>. A user might switch that on for the first time and just leave it like this and keep composing messages there. Icons and hotkeys stay the same.</p>",

A big part of the challenge is just that there's a ton of details that one needs to get right -- all of us have used WYWIWYG experiences where it's impossible to make it look how you want it to or the thing you're typing is annoyingly included in the bold/link/whatever that was next to it in the body.</p>\n<p>This is a solvable problem -- and something we could introduce incrementally as an optional method that isn't the default while we shake out issues -- but it'd be a big investment and I don't think obviates the need to have a good compose experience that is not WYWIWYG for the many users who prefer that.  (Folks may remember Slack had probably their biggest incident of users complaining about their product direction when they changed their compose box to be WYWIWYG, and were forced by that pressure to provide a way to use the old experience).</p>",
