Not only does it have basic cropping functionality, but it also allows for zooming in and cropping specific areas with precision. Additionally, it is compatible with jQuery and has thorough documentation, making it easy to implement and utilize. Using this library will greatly enhance the user's ability to crop images within the Zulip application.</p>\n<p><strong>Github :</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/Foliotek/Croppie\">https://github.com/Foliotek/Croppie</a><br>\n<strong>Demo:</strong> <a href=\"http://foliotek.github.io/Croppie/\">http://foliotek.github.io/Croppie/</a></p>",

Probably many of them are square enough, but there are still probably too many to fix manually. I have no previous experience of scripted image editing, so I decided to file an issue. Mainly because I'm lazy and having this feature in Zulip would save me some effort. And secondly, I believe that current behavior is wrong. Cropping image is \"lossy\" operation and losing user's data silently is not perfect. <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/6023#issuecomment-320275129\">Adding white background has even been implemented</a>, but for unknown reasons was not merged.</p>",
