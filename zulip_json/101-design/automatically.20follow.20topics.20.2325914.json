And these are going to be a lot of notifications in number (much more than mentions/PMs, for which we have the default notification setting as ON).<br>\nSetting this to NEVER might hinder feature discovery, but I think we can find other ways to advertise this feature (for example, in <code>settings/topics</code>, or in the topic popover)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The other (technical) reason is that having the default as \"Topics I start\" skews a lot of our tests, which now need to take into account extra events and notifications. To avoid this, <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/26054#discussion_r1233942081\">I suggested we set the value to NEVER for our test users</a>, but even that is a bit hacky, since it means the real scenario is not reflected in the tests.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",
