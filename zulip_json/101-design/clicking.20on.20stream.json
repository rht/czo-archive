It would have tabs for Streams and PMs (with the tab based on your current narrow).  If you're on the streams pane, there would be a list of streams.  When you clicked on a stream, you'd get a <strong>full</strong> list of topics for that streams.  There'd be bells and whistles for sorting/searching.
