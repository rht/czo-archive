I need to spend more time with it, but a few initial thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For PMs, I wonder if the background is not quite neutral/subtle enough. I think we want it to feel really non-invasive, since it's behind every message as you're reading it.</li>\n<li>The paradigm where mentions that include yourself are bolded and mention color matches background color for messages where you are mentioned makes sense to me.</li>\n<li>Since mentions of other people come up pretty often, I wonder if the purple would be too attention-grabbing? I guess we could try a greyer purple, or a blue -- or perhaps you have other ideas. All else being equal, it could be nice to have @-mentions use brand colors, so if we make individual mentions blue-ish, maybe more rare group mentions can be purplish.</li>\n</ul>",

Ad just wanted to illustrate this nuance. I see it caught your attention, so maybe having focus box tight with an edge is ok.<br>\nYou might suggest having the selection box which 1px or 2px contracted, but in this case it too tight and we would be forced to increase inner vertical paddings of the message by that amount. This by itself isn't bad by I was afraid that it would be too much of a white space between messages</p>",
