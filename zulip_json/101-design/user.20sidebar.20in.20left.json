It's a long PR--16 commits--although most of them are pretty tiny.  It's a fairly low-risk PR.  It's impossible to eliminate risk when touching ancient, disorganized CSS, but I tested fairly carefully, and most of the implications are for the obscure-ish put-right-sidebar-in-left setting.</p>",

However, it introduces a small bug in the scrollbar, because it hides under the navbar sometimes. I don't have a solution for that, but it is related to  <code> .header {\n    position: fixed;\n    top: 0px;</code></p>",
