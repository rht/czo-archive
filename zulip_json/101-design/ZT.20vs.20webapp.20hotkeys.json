After some confusion on plans for keyboard shortcuts for s/S in the webapp, we now have z to toggle zooming in/out of a stream/topic or All-PMs/one-conversation; that's a little difficult to document/describe, but has felt pretty intuitive to use compared to s/S! The other recent addition has been t to toggle between stream-list and topic-list, but that feels like it will definitely need adjusting for a non-keyboard-only app, and pending ongoing changes in ZT.</p>",
