How do these work? From <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-email=\"alicja.raszkowska@gmail.com\" data-user-id=\"431\">@Alicja Raszkowska</span>'s picture I'm imagining there is a 1'' pin in the back, a <img alt=\":octopus:\" class=\"emoji\" src=\"/static/generated/emoji/images/emoji/unicode/1f419.png\" title=\":octopus:\"> printed on cardstock(?), and then maybe two-sided tape sticking the <img alt=\":octopus:\" class=\"emoji\" src=\"/static/generated/emoji/images/emoji/unicode/1f419.png\" title=\":octopus:\"> to the pin?</p>\n<p>Another idea could be to use larger pins (2.25''?), print circular stickers, and then stick the stickers to the pins.</p>",
