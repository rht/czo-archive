E.g. one option would be:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>From: Zulip Administrator</li>\n<li>Subject: Notification of account deactivation on &lt;realm name&gt;</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p>I think the from email should be noreply@ on both fields -- does that sound right?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We should probably include some intro text before the message, along the lines of: \"You Zulip account on &lt;realm name&gt; has been deactivated, and you will no longer be able to log in. The administrator for &lt;realm name&gt; sent the following message:\"</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",
