I had to hit <code>Enter</code> again to perform the search.</p>\n<p>At least for me, searching for a non-operator search term in an already existing narrow might be a common enough case that it would be good to special case it to not require hitting <code>Enter</code> twice. I also usually put the non-operator terms at the end, so for my usage that would be an extra reason to special case it.</p>\n<p>In cases where that solution ends up searching \"too soon\", someone could always go back to the search bar by clicking or with <code>/</code> to add more. But that could be annoying as well. I had a thought; especially now that search pills are a thing, has there been any consideration of having the search results update every time a pill is added/removed? This would solve the \"I expected it to search\" problem. Pressing <code>Enter</code> again could be the way to \"finalize\" the search and go to the results. Maybe the up/down arrow keys could also immediately take you to the results and move the focus box?</p>\n<p>And there are other UX questions to answer.</p>",
