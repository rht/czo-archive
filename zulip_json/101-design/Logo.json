A monochromatic or max, trichromatic design with simple geometry(such that it can be expressed as an svg efficiently).<br>\n2. A set of well defined color schemes for general use of the logo.</p>\n<p>Now, since the logo is mono/di/tri chromatic, it can be printed/used on any media and on any background colors.</p>\n<p>SVG(or rather, simple geometric shape) advantage: we can create animated version of the logo (example: transitions in Google Now App).</p>\n<p>Limited color advantage: can be made to match the theme of other eleents depending on use (example: Microsoft Windows logo. The one they made for Win 8 onwards). They use it in blue on white background and white on other colors in other backgrounds.</p>",
