That is a larger change-set than I really have in mind for this PR. That could go into another PR focused on accessibility that allows users who set a non-default font-size as their default to see the app flow accordingly. The goal for this PR is simply to improve font-legibility given how we're already handling line-spacing units.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"7\">@Tim Abbott</span> It seems this PR has a positive response.
