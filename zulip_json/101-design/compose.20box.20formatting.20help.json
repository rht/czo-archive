People associate it with fonts or formatting, but are surprised that it's a help menu, rather than a way to change font size or expose more formatting buttons (ala Slack).</p>\n<p>We should probably switch it out for a question mark, though I wonder if a plain one (<a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/v4/icon/question\">https://fontawesome.com/v4/icon/question</a>) might fit best in its current location? I think the placement next to the other formatting buttons is still reasonable even if the icon changes.</p>\n<p>I suppose we could also come up with a combined icon that would encode both \"formatting\" and \"help\".</p>",
