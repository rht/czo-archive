But for one I think threaded topics should be the first feature you see. Followed probably by group private messages aka private channels followed by integrated video. After that the most common use-cases for integrations and their logos should be prominently displayed. After that all the rest of the nice-to-have features like markdown, emojis etc etc</p>",
