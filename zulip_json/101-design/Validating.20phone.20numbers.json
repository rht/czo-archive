In this I have used <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/phonenumbers/\">Phone numbers</a> for validating the phone number. For a phone number to be  validated  through this package it must have a country code. But <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"19257\">Alya Abbott</span>  suggested in the review to not have country code in phone number. So can anyone suggest a package which allows validating a phone number without country code.</p>",

This approach sounds pretty reasonable to me. Just want to ask do we currently have a default country associated with an organization so that I can supplement Dialing code of that country.</p>",
