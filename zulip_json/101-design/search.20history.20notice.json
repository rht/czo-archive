The \"End of results\" alert doesn't really make sense until you've seen the \"No search results\" text below it, but it's also easy to visually skip over.</li>\n<li>It's confusing why we didn't just search all public streams in the first place, if that's what one should do.</li>\n<li>As described in <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/17183\">#17183</a>, it's weird not to include private streams with shared history in the expanded search.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One thought is that perhaps we should automatically search all available history when no results are found in the <a href=\"http://17183\">initial user history search</a> we do? That would at least reduce the frequency of this weird experience, so that we would only need to figure out how to make it work well when there <em>are</em> some initial search results.
