It appears faded or pale, particularly when we are on a specific topic where there is only one message header, and the messages are continuous.</p>\n<p>This is also the reverse of the light theme, where we have a brighter color (white) for the message background and a less bright color (grey) for sidebars and other elements.</p>",
