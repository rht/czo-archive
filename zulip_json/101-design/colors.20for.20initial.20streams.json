I think our goal while picking colors should take into account what emotion the stream evokes and what colour uniquely identifies that emotion. To give an example the announce stream is usually surrounded by an air of excitement and celebration. We could pick a much more vibrant, exuberant colour for that that is more “striking”.</p>\n<p>With this in mind I think we should pick colours on 2 axes -</p>\n<p>1) The colour should generally bring about the feeling that stream evokes in a majority of cultures in our demographic<br>\n2) How striking/vibrant that colour is should be chosen by taking into account what order it meets the eye in comparison with other colours in the palette. I believe this has to do the with the wavelength of light in the spectrum ( perhaps my physics is off here ) but basically that means red meets the eye first as compared to say blue.</p>",
