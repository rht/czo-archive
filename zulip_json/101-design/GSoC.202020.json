Sometimes we simply have lots of PRs in the queue, so having a lot of folks asking to have their PRs get merged doesn't help a lot.  There are several things under your control, though:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>put a little extra attention into your PR description, so that it clearly states what you're fixing (sort of the same principles apply to PR descriptions as commit messages--be concise, be precise, use good grammar, etc.)</li>\n<li>make sure your build passes</li>\n<li>address any feedback that you've already gotten</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another good way to engage here is to ask a pretty specific question about something that's pertinent to your PR.  That can sometimes start a good conversation and help improve the quality of the PRs.</p>\n<p>I know that doesn't directly answer your question, but I hope it helps!</p>",

If somebody has already engaged you on a PR and if there has maybe been some discussion on chat about the PR already, it's fine to mention here that you've addressed concerns, but even that can be a bit unnecessary at time.  It's mostly harmless, of course, so people shouldn't feel bad about doing it.  But really the way reviews tend to be prioritized is that Tim looks at GH and uses his own heuristics of what to review next.</p>",
