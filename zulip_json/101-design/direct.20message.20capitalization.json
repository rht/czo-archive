The plan (cf. <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/25116\">#25116</a>) had been to use \"Direct Message\". It's currently merged as \"Direct message\" as a last-minute linter failure fix. But we should decide what we actually want. :)</p>\n<p>The idea with \"Direct Message\" is that it is more consistent with the \"DM\" abbreviation, which we are using once that option is selected. (And \"Dm\" would look quite odd.) \"Direct message\" follows our general sentence case pattern.</p>",
