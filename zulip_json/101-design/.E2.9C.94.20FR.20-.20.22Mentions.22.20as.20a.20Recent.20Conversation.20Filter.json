It would be really useful for us to be able to filter conversations as ones where we were mentioned in, but not necessarily ones we've directly participated in (or a combination filter between the two would also work well). As there currently is no differentiation between a direct Mention and a group-level Mention, this can lead to needing to toggle between the two sidebar items frequently in organizations where groups are used heavily like ours. </p>\n<p>If there's already a topic on this, feel free to move the message, I couldn't find any in my brief search.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Disregard, I just noticed that I had a separate topic a while back that was similar in nature that I'd forgotten about. Whoops!</p>",
