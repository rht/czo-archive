I guess this is an example of where our own choices have made the name worse than the data we started from -- our <code>:spock:</code> is a bad name for that, and <code>:spock_hand:</code> would be less bad. But the name we'd get from CLDR, <code>:vulcan_salute:</code>, is actually good instead.</p>\n<p><span aria-label=\"repeat one\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f502\" role=\"img\" title=\"repeat one\">:repeat_one:</span> is <code>:repeat_one:</code>.
