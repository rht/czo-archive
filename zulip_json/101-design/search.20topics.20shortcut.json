It uses <code>Q</code>, same as stream name search when you are <em>not</em> inside <strong>more topics</strong>.</p>\n<p>Do folks think this is worth doing? Opening \"more topics\" immediately places your cursor into the search box, but I don't see a handy way to get back to it if you navigate away, e.g. if you got to a topic and decide it's not the one you were looking for.
