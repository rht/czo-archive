It's a cancer—definitely not useful to us since by now we override almost every one of its styles, but also hard to remove because almost every one of our styles are framed in terms of a delta from Bootstrap. It causes weird issues, it's anti-modular, and it contributes to the general incomprehensibility of our CSS. We need to get rid of it but there isn't really a way to do that gradually.</p>\n<p>So anyway, if you want to interact with it for some reason, you need to excavate the ancient Bootstrap 2 documentation.
