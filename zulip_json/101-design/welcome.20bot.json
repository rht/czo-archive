For context, here's the current message: […]</p>\n<p>I was impressed with how <a href=\"https://quill.chat\">Quill</a> does this — their messages look like <a href=\"/user_uploads/2/27/s_GSZEo38HFyOTi_zmokNe2l/0000-recent.png\">this</a>.</p>\n<p>I think it's likely that the \"confirm your name\" makes people way more likely to actually reply to the Welcome Bot, which is a good way to get them used to sending messages.
