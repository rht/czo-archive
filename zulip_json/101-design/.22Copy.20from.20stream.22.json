But there is no explicit indication to the user that this is what we're doing, and I think it can be very confusing to see a kind-of-but-not-actually alphabetical list. So I think we should figure out a way to make the behavior explicitly indicated.</p>\n<p>A couple of options come to mind:<br>\n1) Have two sections you can open up: \"Copy from subscribed streams\", and \"Copy from all streams\". Each one would just list the relevant streams in alphabetical order.<br>\n2) Keep the one section you can open but add labels for the two groups of streams underneath. I'm not sure how to make that work well visually.</p>\n<p>Thoughts?</p>",
