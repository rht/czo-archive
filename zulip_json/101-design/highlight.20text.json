Alert-words I think is different than what I'm suggesting.<br>\nWhat I mean by highlight-text is lets say I write some text, and I bold some text by using asterisk, so I may lets say want to highlight the text as well, Or make it italic. Now making the text bold and italic, we already have that. In addition we may have this highlight text feature as well. Again For example like this: <br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/f7/ZJnOn-4FhNo02sfNRa83rTFj/unnamed.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"unnamed.jpg\">unnamed.jpg</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/f7/ZJnOn-4FhNo02sfNRa83rTFj/unnamed.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"unnamed.jpg\"><img data-src-fullsize=\"/thumbnail?url=user_uploads%2F2%2Ff7%2FZJnOn-4FhNo02sfNRa83rTFj%2Funnamed.jpg&amp;size=full\" src=\"/thumbnail?url=user_uploads%2F2%2Ff7%2FZJnOn-4FhNo02sfNRa83rTFj%2Funnamed.jpg&amp;size=thumbnail\"></a></div>",
