I'd like feedback on whether anyone saw the deprecation notice and was confused, and also on how folks are doing on retraining their muscle memory.</p>",

(I thinks this is intended  to show it only once). But I usually forget the change in practice if I am too fond of it. So again hitting <code>C</code> few times again, it its better to show it again :) <span class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span></p>",
