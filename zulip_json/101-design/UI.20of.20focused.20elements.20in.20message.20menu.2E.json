I agree it can look less nice than no box, but the box is important for accessibility. When using a mouse, you don't need the box because you're clicking on the elements and know where the focus is (you just clicked there) and will use a mouse to click to the next spot (so you don't need to keep track of where focus is on the page).</p>\n<p>I'm not an expert on this topic, so someone correct me if this isn't the case, but I believe that's what's going on here :)</p>",
