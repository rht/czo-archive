        "content": "<p>Thanks for the suggestion, I looked up for the solutions to tackle this issue and came up with following ideas: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>In order to generate the <code>.ics</code>(calendar-file) from client side, we can use <a href=\"https://github.com/nwcell/ics.js\"><code>ics.js</code></a>, but it doesn't work in IE with version 9 or below  and its pretty much an abandoned project.</li>\n<li>Using <a href=\"https://github.com/AnandChowdhary/calendar-link\"><code>calendar-link</code></a> is also a way, since it allows to generate links as well as to download the <code>.ics</code> file. But the drawback being, it uses <a href=\"https://github.com/AnandChowdhary/calendar-link/blob/master/package.json#L51\"><code>day.js</code></a> as one of its dependencies and we migrated to <code>date-fns</code> recently (<a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/16451\">#16451</a>). Adding a similar package doesn't seem right to me (?). (Although, day.js is a very small package).</li>\n<li>There's an existing <a href=\"https://github.com/tardate/jquery.addtocalendar\">jquery plugin</a> that creates a widget for calendar links. We need to manually modify its source code to our usage.</li>\n<li>We can also have our own functions doing the job of creating <code>.ics</code> file. For reference:- <a href=\"https://jsfiddle.net/Twisty/6sye1f75/\">https://jsfiddle.net/Twisty/6sye1f75/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The link above suggested by Tim has an hardcoded approach (<a href=\"https://litmus.com/builder/24b1815\">https://litmus.com/builder/24b1815</a>).<br>\nWould love any other suggestions/thoughts regarding it.</p>",
