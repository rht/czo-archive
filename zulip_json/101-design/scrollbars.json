There's some things we'd like to fix on top of this (many of which were things we wanted to fix with the old scrollbar library), but I'd love it if (A) everyone paid attention to any weird scrollbar behaviors/regressions that you see over the next couple days and reported them here and (B) A few folks did a more extensive QA pass looking for things that seem busted.</p>",
