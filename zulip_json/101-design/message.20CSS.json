I suspect there will be some smaller tweaks we'll do on top of this over the coming days to adjust 1-3px in a few places to make things look nicer, but I just wanted to flag this change as a potential source for bugs that everyone should be on the look for starting in about 5 minutes when the deploy finishes. <span aria-label=\"slight smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"slight smile\">:slight_smile:</span></p>\n<p>I'd like to thank <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"11190\">@Vinit Singh</span> for helping pushing this forward -- his work helped me figure out what we should do to make this more rational.
