However, the issue was written a year ago, and a lot has changed since then. With the new direct messages section, the proposed issue does not seem to be right with the current UI. I tried to solve the issue, but I think the issue description needs to be changed. I think instead of replacing the location of the three dots with unread counts, maybe the unread counts should be placed in the location of the three dots to maintain consistency.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/be/nErmZAcUiN-P6rOZvhkvCpFZ/Screenshot-from-2023-04-02-22-41-13.png\">Screenshot-from-2023-04-02-22-41-13.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/be/nErmZAcUiN-P6rOZvhkvCpFZ/Screenshot-from-2023-04-02-22-41-13.png\" title=\"Screenshot-from-2023-04-02-22-41-13.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/be/nErmZAcUiN-P6rOZvhkvCpFZ/Screenshot-from-2023-04-02-22-41-13.png\"></a></div>",
