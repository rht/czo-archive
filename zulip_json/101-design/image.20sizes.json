Especially gifs. Many messages is nothing but a gif.</p>\n<p>But Zulip scalling image the image down to preview size kinda takes the punch out of ones carefully selected gif.</p>\n<p>So here's a radical suggestion: Let images be full width if they're large enough (\"full\" being limited to the maximum text with, which is dependent on the \"Use full width on wide screens\" option). It worked very nicely for Flowdock: <a href=\"http://blog.flowdock.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/the-next-flowdock.png\">http://blog.flowdock.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/the-next-flowdock.png</a> (note: that's a single image with built in borders). OK, setting a max-height to something that's less than the users screen height is needed to account for hi-res portrait  images from phones, but that's a detail.</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"http://blog.flowdock.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/the-next-flowdock.png\"><img src=\"/external_content/c09f906f218d03c736c1e8268b7ad79a13ff5631/687474703a2f2f626c6f672e666c6f77646f636b2e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323031342f30372f7468652d6e6578742d666c6f77646f636b2e706e67\"></a></div><p>As it is currently, images seems like a second class citizen to text. They're there, but you have to click them to see them, any text on them is mostly unreadable. At full width they become first class citizens, you'll be able to get a graphical message across without having to have people click on the image.</p>\n<p>This could be tired to the most spacious display setting.</p>",

One important constraint with images is that unless we change the markup, it's very important for loading/scrolling user experience that the browser knows the precise size of an image element before it fetches the image over the network; otherwise you'll see the screen jumping around as images are loaded and the browser makes room for them in the DOM.</p>\n<p>So there's two possible paths:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We change to a new fixed height, say 300px with this setting, and all images are shown at that height instead.</li>\n<li>We change the markup, by adding code that loads the image, does some processing, and then embeds size details (well, at least the height) in the HTML markup so that the browser has access to that information when rendering.</li>\n</ul>",
