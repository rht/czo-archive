A few bits of feedback from playing with the PR:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As noted just above, we still need to figure out how to start navigation with the top option (not the three dots) in the main part of the menu when it's opened with the mouse.</li>\n<li>I think opening the three dot menu should immediately select the top option in the menu, rather than keeping the focus on the three dots.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once you're in the three-dot menu, there's no way to navigate back out to the other options. I'm not sure what exactly the right solution is, but maybe one or both of:<br>\n   a) Esc could close the inner menu, leaving the selection on the three dots, and the user profile popover open.<br>\n   b) Going up from the top option could move the focus to the three dots, and then maybe the left arrow would bring you to the other options and close the menu? If so, the left arrow should work in general for navigating away from the three dots to other options.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It looks like there's both a box and an underline on the three dots when they are selected; we should remove the underline.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/e2/obzeexuFblX7jwGOB5Ooracn/Screen-Shot-2022-10-06-at-10.34.23-AM.png\">Screen-Shot-2022-10-06-at-10.34.23-AM.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/e2/obzeexuFblX7jwGOB5Ooracn/Screen-Shot-2022-10-06-at-10.34.23-AM.png\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2022-10-06-at-10.34.23-AM.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/e2/obzeexuFblX7jwGOB5Ooracn/Screen-Shot-2022-10-06-at-10.34.23-AM.png\"></a></div>",
