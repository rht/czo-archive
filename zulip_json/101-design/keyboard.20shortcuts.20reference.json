Several problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you have tabs, one expects that there's a panel for each tab, and when you select a different tab you see the panel that that tab is connected to. The sort order doesn't behave like this -- it's an option for how to present a single panel, not a selection of different panels -- so tabs aren't a good fit.</li>\n<li>Similarly, \"Subscribed\" vs \"All streams\" isn't two different panels -- it's two filters on a single list. So tabs aren't a good fit.</li>\n<li>It's weird to have two different sets of \"tabs\" that are simultaneously controlling a single panel. This is basically another angle on the above two points.</li>\n<li>In the right half: tabs could be appropriate, as there really are three different panels. But the visual design is off. For example, those blue highlights look like they're trying to be on a dividing line between the tabs and the panel, but the design lacks such a line.</li>\n</ul>",
