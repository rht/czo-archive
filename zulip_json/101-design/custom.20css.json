There have been folks who have shared their own solutions on this chat realm, but when I searched for \"custom css\", it was a bit noisy.  Obviously, anybody who maintains their own themes will have to accept the risk that future changes to Zulip's css structure could break things, but I think that's a risk that many folks are happy to accept.</p>",
