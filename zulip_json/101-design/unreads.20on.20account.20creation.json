But if you're caught up, the client doesn't get much history and Recent Topics can feel kind of broken. And I guess the same thing is probably true of the left sidebar, if you're trying to use it to browse around.</p>\n<p>A new user is naturally fully caught up. It seems like perhaps one thing that's going on here is that the experience of being fully caught up and trying to browse around isn't great. In that case, we should probably have the client fetch more history so that the experience is good.</p>",
