Proposed way was to add <code>topic-contains:</code> search filter and from what I understood we have to do partial phrase match on topic. Eg. If there are topics: <code>Some Topic Name</code>, <code>Another Topic Name</code> and user search <code>topic-contains: Topic</code> the search results have messages with topics:   <code>Some Topic Name</code>, <code>Another Topic Name</code>.</p>\n<p>So is this what we want to provide user or should we want to provide something else?<br>\nCorrect me if I am wrong,  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"7\">@Tim Abbott</span>  your suggestion to discuss this <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/12328\">https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/12328</a> here was to gather more ideas and discussion regarding this feature, right?</p>",
