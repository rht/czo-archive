We'll probably go with a matte cloth banner (screen printed), which is what the nicer banners are made out of.</p>\n<p>Would anyone be interested in designing or helping design such a banner? You can see examples of banners by google image searching for \"conference banner\" and similar. (Though we can definitely be less corporate looking than average.) We can figure out the text later, mainly we're looking for the graphic elements of the design.</p>",
