We have not been able to successfully implement that idea, because we already have a whole-row tooltip for the region:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/d3/jVDy1qCNxgAhXlo8mGZVB2K5/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/d3/jVDy1qCNxgAhXlo8mGZVB2K5/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/d3/jVDy1qCNxgAhXlo8mGZVB2K5/image.png\"></a></div><p>See <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/24976\">#24976</a> for discussion of some alternative ideas.</p>\n<p>Relatedly, I did just merge <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/26383\">#26383</a>, which shows the name of the emoji when hovering over status emoji in the user card, which is at least something in this direction, but I don't think it scratches the itch of the original problem.</p>",

Partly because for folks who choose to just decorate their names with an emoji (like my <code>:octopus:</code>) using this feature, it'll be the case that their sidebar now have <code>:octopus:</code> on a line by itself, without clear explanation as to what this is; it'll really feel like I literally typed the word \"octopus\" into my status or something.</p>\n<p>So maybe the right answer is to either solve the technical problem of having a different tooltip when hovered specifically over the emoji, or decide to settle with being able to find out the emoji name from the user card as we just implemented?
