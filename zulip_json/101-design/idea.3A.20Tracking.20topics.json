In a large chat, where there are many conversations, it is easy to lose track (in the history) of conversations you are part of.<br>\nI'd like to suggest two features:<br>\n1) A chat filter similar to \"Starred messages\", where it shows you all of the topics you have participated in.<br>\n2) A feature similar to \"Starred messages\", but for \"Starred topics\", where the entire topic is starred, rather than just one message within the topic. I don't see flagging a single message as very useful, but flagging an entire topic would be very useful.</p>",
