Opening a scheduled message for editing is a more \"destructive\" action, in that it unschedules it. But the time you'd had it scheduled for is offered in the \"...\" menu, so it's not actually hard to reschedule.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I might be inclined to keep the current behavior, where clicking anywhere on a draft or scheduled message opens it in the compose box. Curious what other folks think.</p>",
