I did try reading docs but as Tim mentioned apart from ranges mentioned over there we have to just choose these values ourselves. So what I did was pick up an image and try out different values locally. I just chose those values which seemed to make the image look a bit more clear (that is the edges inside the image seemed to have became more visible even when it was a thumbnail). I guess this is what sharpening itself means! <br>\nI used the below image when I was figuring the values. Seemed to have made boundaries of the figure in the image more evident so I chose those values.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/f/DNAkVnq5CZVVGPWDF1S77Sy7/_MG_0452.JPG\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"_MG_0452.JPG\">_MG_0452.JPG</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/f/DNAkVnq5CZVVGPWDF1S77Sy7/_MG_0452.JPG\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"_MG_0452.JPG\"><img data-src-fullsize=\"/thumbnail?url=user_uploads%2F2%2Ff%2FDNAkVnq5CZVVGPWDF1S77Sy7%2F_MG_0452.JPG&amp;size=full\" src=\"/thumbnail?url=user_uploads%2F2%2Ff%2FDNAkVnq5CZVVGPWDF1S77Sy7%2F_MG_0452.JPG&amp;size=thumbnail\"></a></div><p>If you would like I can deploy some values on nightly as well and see which one looks good (when you are online) :)</p>\n<p>Also you can try out different values in your own dev environment if you would like. I can pin point the exact line where you can just change the settings and server would hot reload and you can see changes in the image rendered.

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"1113\">@Aditya Bansal</span> yeah, I suspect there has to be some trial-and-error process in the end.<br>\nSharpening generally works by finding edges in the image (sometimes the threshold of the difference in luminescence is also configurable) and then applying a 'halo' like effect - a dark one on the darker side of the edge and lighter on the lighter. When done very subtly it almost 'magically' enhances the details, but can definitely be overdone ;)</p>",
