The columns could be: user_id, hotkey, action. (This would mean we don’t support the corner case of a user wanting to configure different hotkeys on different devices.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use user_id and action as primary key because action is a fixed value space (other option would be user_id and hotkey). This would mean that a user can not have two hotkeys for the same action, which is not very useful anyway. The user can only choose to change the hotkey for an action, they can not define a new action. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Either store all actions (with null for default) or only overrides.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>storing all actions advantages: logic to determine action for a hotkey is slightly less complex, logic to update hotkey for an action doesn’t require a fetch</li>\n<li>storing all actions disadvantages: adding a new default hotkey is expensive because a new row has to be added for all users</li>\n<li>vice versa for storing only overrides</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The interface for the database could be: <code>get_user_hotkeys(user_id)</code> <code>update_hotkey_for_action(user_id, action)</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Is it necessary to add a new migration in <code>migrations</code> for adding a new table?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To ensure performance the hotkey mapping has to be cached in the browser.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There may be a conflict if new default hotkeys are added and the key combination is already used by a custom hotkey. This can only happen after an update. Every time the desktop app is opened it should be checked for a conflict and in case show a popup that directs the user to the settings to fix the conflict. Same for the web app.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I would like to focus on the backend first, before thinking about the frontend.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
