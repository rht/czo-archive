Further, if you look closely, the blue box isn't centered properly around 1-line messages in this currently deployed version (there's more space above the text than below, which can be visually distracting) -- so that's probably a (related) bug.</p>\n<p>To talk about the philosophy here: A lot of the time, one is posting a series of thoughts on something, each in their own paragraph, and if nobody else is posting messages, we want it to feel like your decisions about when to hit enter and continue in a next message can be based on editorial considerations -- things like whether this message is already a complete thought that you'd like folks to be able to emoji react to and your next paragraph is going to be an independent thought, or if you want to let others see what you've written so far as you write the rest to provide a better real-time experience for them, etc., without changing materially the visual experience of reading your series of paragraphs.</p>\n<p>Having slightly different spaces also just looks visually less nice -- it can be distracting to see a series of paragraphs that have mixed/choppy spacing. (Every time we regress this, we start getting a slow stream of bug reports \"these paragraph breaks look funny\", and I think there's a reason for that ... and I even remember some folks wanting to do things like edit messages to copy/paste the later ones into the first one and then delete the rest to get the paragraph spacing they want, which seems like a bad outcome).</p>",

Previously, my eyes would fixate immediately on the currently selected message.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From another user:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'm on dark mode. I tend to find the title bars distracting, they're given a lot of visual weight by their relatively saturated backgrounds. I do like how they're colored based on the stream's key color, which makes it easy to pick out streams from a list of messages when you're searching or looking at drafts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And from yet another:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'm mostly able to find where I am by blindly using the up or down arrows to change the focused message until it causes the screen to scroll, but that is annoying, and still requires me to look carefully at the screen until I can find the one with the extra border.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Outline focus rect on the whole message makes this very visible. So until we have a smart good working solution for \"don't show me the focus rectangle until I need it\" I personally reluctant to go there. Also the recent suggestion to make 2px line instead of 1px faces some resistance from the focus rect lovers, which was somewhat surprising for me. <br>\nI like that we stopped where we are now, but still not a fan of bold unread indicator. Focus rect and unread indicator are supposed to be related and right now it is a bit ugly. I do understand that 1px unread indicator might be too weak.</p>\n<p>Another problem as Alya already highlighted is unread indicator should be visible even when focus rect is on a message, because a user should be able to see it on and off. Quick and ugly proposal is to show unread marker somehow inside focus rect:<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/84/DKIs9DGe0UDygbhOg5IpC40e/image.png\">image.png</a> <br>\nwhich makes that even more visible than 2px line outside.</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/84/DKIs9DGe0UDygbhOg5IpC40e/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/84/DKIs9DGe0UDygbhOg5IpC40e/image.png\"></a></div>",
