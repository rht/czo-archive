We still have a bunch of further things planned here, most notably hooking it up with <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/14066\" title=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/14066\">https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/14066</a> and related follow-ups, but I'd love it if folks did some testing to make sure it works as they expect, and provided any feedback!  Here's what it looks like now:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/4b/PaIIxW_-S2sVZffZMFcM79Sw/image.png\" title=\"image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/4b/PaIIxW_-S2sVZffZMFcM79Sw/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/4b/PaIIxW_-S2sVZffZMFcM79Sw/image.png\"></a></div><p>At the very least, I suspect there's probably some visual styling work that could be done on the table borders to make it look a lot prettier.  Meanwhile I expect <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"9117\">@Pragati Agrawal</span> and the other folks who've been working on it to be focused on continuing improving the functionality.</p>",
