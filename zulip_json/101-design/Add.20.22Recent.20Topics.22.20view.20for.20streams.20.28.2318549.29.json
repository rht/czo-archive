Chatting with <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"7\">Tim Abbott</span> , a relatively straightforward way to do this from a technical perspective would be a notice that says: \"You're viewing conversations with messages sent since [date]. <a href=\"http://\">Load older conversations</a>\" (exact wording TBD).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add the same notice to the stream-based view. This is where it's pretty critical, because there may well be very few conversations to show once we filter by stream.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rather than opening the recent topics-style view from the left sidebar, have it open via clicking the name of a stream in Recent conversations. (This currently goes to the topic rather than the stream, which is a bit odd, but we had wanted to avoid taking users to an interleaved view.) This is a low-visibility access point, but would allow us to integrate all the technical changes without having to nail UX questions at the same time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Test on CZO opening this view from clicking a stream name in the left side bar (as in the current PR). I'm not sure if we need to add an interleaved stream view button, similar to the one we have for DMs, or if we can test it without. Regardless, we'll likely want that button for the actual feature.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>How does that sound?</p>",
