Although we liked Zulip's information architecture from users' perspective quite a lot, sadly we decided not to change our main chat platform just yet.</p>\n<p>The most difficult moment of this experiment was our first day, when we  (&gt;100ppl) had to confront the unconventionality of the Zulip's UI.<br>\nI tried to make it easier for myself and my colleagues and received quite a positive <img alt=\":party_parrot:\" class=\"emoji\" src=\"/user_avatars/2/emoji/images/76.gif\" title=\"party parrot\"> feedback on this <a href=\"https://github.com/goldsteinsveta/zulip-theme\">custom css here</a>.</p>\n<p>There are three main aspects it tackles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Poor legibility</strong> – less dense, more contrasting typography gives more definition to each semantic element: titles, messages, reactions, quotes etc and difference between them</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Feeling of being overwhelmed</strong> – removed indication of continuity of the stream, hovered messages, greyed out quoted text, use of bg instead of borders to highlight information where possible, other accents help to  <em>focus on reading the current message instead of being reminded of the whole</em> context all the time</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>\"Outdated\" \"look and feel\"</strong> – rounded corners, thinner borders, typography</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hope you could try it out and consider these points as improvement suggestions very much as I personally miss Zulip's features quite a lot <span aria-label=\"new moon face\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f31a\" role=\"img\" title=\"new moon face\">:new_moon_face:</span></p>",
