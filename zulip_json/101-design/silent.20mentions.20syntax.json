We're adding support for silent mentions, basically for use cases where you want to mention someone but not trigger a notification.  The question is what syntax to use (see <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/11166#issuecomment-452997687\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/11166#issuecomment-452997687\">https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/11166#issuecomment-452997687</a>).  The bottom two are the currently suggested options:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>@**Iago**\n@**Iago|123**\n.@**Iago**\n@.**Iago**\n@_**Iago**\n_@**Iago**\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>(This feature would be used internally in the implementation for not mentioning users when messages they sent are quoted, but also is useful for applications like the notification-bot explaining who created or renamed a stream).</p>",
