I think the product also seems to be converging on non-colored buttons as the \"default\" button color.<br>\nIf you're looking to improve the visual design of some stuff, there are several places that could use a lot of work. Let me know if that would be of interest and we can coordinate with Brock and others to make sure we don't duplicate work.</p>",
