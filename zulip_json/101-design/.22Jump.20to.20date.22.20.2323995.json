Even though I set the return type to any (as recommended <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43910979/mypy-error-incompatible-types-in-assignment\">here</a>), it still complains about inner_msg_id_col. Why?<br>\nEdit: I know, any is not recommended. So I will change return type, but to  understand mypy better, I had to ask this problem. <a href=\"/user_uploads/2/dd/-D_9iAz2xJtENaKj-y4rbRgy/Screenshot-from-2023-02-05-23-27-47.png\">Screenshot-from-2023-02-05-23-27-47.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/dd/-D_9iAz2xJtENaKj-y4rbRgy/Screenshot-from-2023-02-05-23-27-47.png\" title=\"Screenshot-from-2023-02-05-23-27-47.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/dd/-D_9iAz2xJtENaKj-y4rbRgy/Screenshot-from-2023-02-05-23-27-47.png\"></a></div>",
