No button if there are no unread topics.</li>\n<li>\"Next unread PM thread (p) button in the blank space at the bottom of a PM conversation narrow.

How should this relate to those?  My initial answer is this should always be after these things (including bit of vertical buffer we leave for the loading indicator so that it can disappear without anything changing position).</li>\n<li>How do we handle the \"Next unread topic\" vs. \"Next unread PM\" issue -- e.g. should what we offer depend on whether you're currently looking at a topic or a PM conversation?  (Or do we show both, which would make the element a lot bigger?)</li>\n<li>How do we handle the interactions if you have no unreads of the relevant type?  Does it just result in a thing you can click that doesn't do anything, or that pops a small \"You've read everything\" tooltip, or something else?</li>\n<li>There's a potential interaction with this specific position that it will be an element that moves down every time a new message arrives, and that could be annoying/distracting.  I don't think we can easily evaluate whether that'll be a real problem until we try it.</li>\n</ul>",
