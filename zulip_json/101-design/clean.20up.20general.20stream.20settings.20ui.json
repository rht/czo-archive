Zulip supports constructing the Zulip message<br>\n  content using either (converting HTML to Markdown for the HTML<br>\n  format).  By default, Zulip will prefer using the plain text version<br>\n  of an email over the converted HTML version if both are present.<br>\n  This option overrides that behavior to prefer the HTML version<br>\n  instead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>.prefer-text</strong>: Similar to <code>.prefer-html</code>, but explicitly asks<br>\n  Zulip to prefer the plain text version of the email if both are<br>\n  present (the current default behavior).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
