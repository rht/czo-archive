As came up recently in a support request, Zulip does not make it convenient to figure out what Zulip Cloud plan your organization is on, and how to change it.</p>\n<p>At present, owners of Zulip Cloud Free orgs see a link to plans in the gear menu:<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/9c/pShOti1_Py6APfRrG6s3o9pN/menu-free.png\">menu-free.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/9c/pShOti1_Py6APfRrG6s3o9pN/menu-free.png\" title=\"menu-free.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/9c/pShOti1_Py6APfRrG6s3o9pN/menu-free.png\"></a></div><p>Owners of Zulip Cloud Standard orgs see a billing link instead:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/35/WyVT4vG-gj9jCwM-erMNCfAE/menu-standard.png\">menu-standard.png</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/35/WyVT4vG-gj9jCwM-erMNCfAE/menu-standard.png\" title=\"menu-standard.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/35/WyVT4vG-gj9jCwM-erMNCfAE/menu-standard.png\"></a></div><p>However, until you go to <code>/plans</code> or the billing page, it's really not obvious what plan you're currently on. Contrast this with Slack, which makes it clear upfront in the org drop-down menu:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/69/9b9iF86v5Ii0Ya2WhaBruSkn/Screen-Shot-2022-06-02-at-3.41.18-PM.png\">Screen-Shot-2022-06-02-at-3.41.18-PM.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/69/9b9iF86v5Ii0Ya2WhaBruSkn/Screen-Shot-2022-06-02-at-3.41.18-PM.png\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2022-06-02-at-3.41.18-PM.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/69/9b9iF86v5Ii0Ya2WhaBruSkn/Screen-Shot-2022-06-02-at-3.41.18-PM.png\"></a></div><p>I think we should also make it more clear in-app (a) what plan you're on, and (b) how to upgrade (or downgrade). What are some ideas on how to approach it? A couple of directions that come to mind:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Adding a \"Zulip Cloud plan\" (or something similar) section to org settings, probably as part of the \"Organization settings\" panel.</li>\n<li>Having the info be more clear/prominent/explicit in the gear menu dropdown.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What do folks think?</p>",
