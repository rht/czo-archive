As recently came up in the discussion on <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"243\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/243-mobile-team/topic/Dark.20mode.20preference\">#mobile-team &gt; Dark mode preference</a> , we should probably reorganized the Display settings panel a bit. In particular, we now have a bunch of emoji settings (plus <strong>Add option to show names for a small number of reactions</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/20980\">#20980</a> is a release goal), so it would make sense to have a dedicated Emoji section in that panel. That probably means we should move the dark/light theme dropdown into the top section, alongside language and time:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/eb/tZayQzlFdxS9zsI1WuwU0ptY/Screen-Shot-2022-10-17-at-9.14.19-PM.png\">Screen-Shot-2022-10-17-at-9.14.19-PM.png</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/eb/tZayQzlFdxS9zsI1WuwU0ptY/Screen-Shot-2022-10-17-at-9.14.19-PM.png\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2022-10-17-at-9.14.19-PM.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/eb/tZayQzlFdxS9zsI1WuwU0ptY/Screen-Shot-2022-10-17-at-9.14.19-PM.png\"></a></div><p>With this change, what do folks think would be a good name for that top section?
