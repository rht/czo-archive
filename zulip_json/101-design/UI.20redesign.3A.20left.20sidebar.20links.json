Specifically, there have been a number of recent proposals for adding more shortcuts to the left sidebar (e.g., <a href=\"#narrow/stream/137-feedback/topic/pinned.20searches/near/1493902\">here</a>), and I think that might go nicely with the proposed change to move from a list of views in the top left to a design with  ~5 icons and a 3-dot menu for the rest.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/7a/ldBpXKiraPhOKvKeAVDhR1vk/Screen-Shot-2023-01-23-at-1.43.27-PM.png\">Screen-Shot-2023-01-23-at-1.43.27-PM.png</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/7a/ldBpXKiraPhOKvKeAVDhR1vk/Screen-Shot-2023-01-23-at-1.43.27-PM.png\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2023-01-23-at-1.43.27-PM.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/7a/ldBpXKiraPhOKvKeAVDhR1vk/Screen-Shot-2023-01-23-at-1.43.27-PM.png\"></a></div><p>Concretely:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For now, we just have 5 buttons for the 5 links that are currently there.</li>\n<li>When we add the Inbox view (<a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/22189\">#22189</a>), we could hide whichever one of All messages and Recent conversations that the user did not pick as their default view.

Upon rechecking today, I can confirm that the alignment issue is not there. Therefore, it appears that the alignment issue was not caused by recent code changes and might have occurred due to some other issue.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/2/c2/8eQcinI3E12_nHlFEEFUxaKl/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/c2/8eQcinI3E12_nHlFEEFUxaKl/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/c2/8eQcinI3E12_nHlFEEFUxaKl/image.png\"></a></div>",
