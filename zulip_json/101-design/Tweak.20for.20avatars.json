However, there's uncertainty about the best approach. I'd appreciate your input on this matter to determine the most suitable solution for our design.</p>\n<p>The goal is to maintain a consistent and visually clear distinction between bot users and guest users. Your insights and suggestions would be valuable in making an informed decision.</p>\n<p>You can find the relevant PR here: PR <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/26301\">#26301</a></p>",
