I think because its a canvas element it probably doesn't adhere to standard things you can do with images like drag them or copy the, copy their links etc. But I think just having a \"Back to Actual Size\" button would be intuitive enough for people to know to do that before they tried to do those things. ( I've also seen a ton of ecommerce sites that don't allow you to perform any of those actions within their zoom viewer so its not the most evil thing in the world ).</p>",
