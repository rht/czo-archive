(In part because a substantial amount of new subscriptions come from other users creating streams and adding others to them).  Whether or not you agree with that precise statement, I certainly think we should optimize for the use case of subscribing to several streams in a sequence, since \"browsing and then subscribing\" feels like a common thing to want to do.</p>",
