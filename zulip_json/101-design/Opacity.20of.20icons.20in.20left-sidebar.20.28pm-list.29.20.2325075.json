However, for all the icons in the left-sidebar, we use an opacity of <code>0.7px</code>, except for the <code>presence dot</code>. Should we apply the opacity to the presence dot as well? I have pushed the changes with the implementation of this, and will revert it if it is not required.</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Before:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/b1/HPc_OQVeLvo2FrWjQRg50Lft/Screenshot-from-2023-04-18-04-46-35.png\">Screenshot-from-2023-04-18-04-46-35.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/b1/HPc_OQVeLvo2FrWjQRg50Lft/Screenshot-from-2023-04-18-04-46-35.png\" title=\"Screenshot-from-2023-04-18-04-46-35.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/b1/HPc_OQVeLvo2FrWjQRg50Lft/Screenshot-from-2023-04-18-04-46-35.png\"></a></div><hr>\n<ul>\n<li>New: </li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/3b/f50tf8-BX3sYMJhzumP3X9Mp/Screenshot-from-2023-04-18-04-42-38.png\">Screenshot-from-2023-04-18-04-42-38.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/3b/f50tf8-BX3sYMJhzumP3X9Mp/Screenshot-from-2023-04-18-04-42-38.png\" title=\"Screenshot-from-2023-04-18-04-42-38.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/3b/f50tf8-BX3sYMJhzumP3X9Mp/Screenshot-from-2023-04-18-04-42-38.png\"></a></div>",
