I'd like to hear what everyone thinks about how it looks, there's two windows so it's clear how it appears for the user editing and for other people seeing the message that gets edited. Animation is slightly less exact when actually submitted:<br>\n<a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33805964/52807593-f3415300-30b1-11e9-9b4b-3e58b242e4f1.gif\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33805964/52807593-f3415300-30b1-11e9-9b4b-3e58b242e4f1.gif\">https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33805964/52807593-f3415300-30b1-11e9-9b4b-3e58b242e4f1.gif</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33805964/52807593-f3415300-30b1-11e9-9b4b-3e58b242e4f1.gif\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33805964/52807593-f3415300-30b1-11e9-9b4b-3e58b242e4f1.gif\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33805964/52807593-f3415300-30b1-11e9-9b4b-3e58b242e4f1.gif\"></a></div>",

What this does is add an animation for that which is a combination of a slide in as well as a fade in. The change for topic edits is also similar, I'll upload a gif of how it currently looks in a moment.</p>",
