I feel like when searching for something it would be much more helpful if results were split up into a Topics pane up top and a keyword matches pane below for content within topics. This would make the experience of discovering previously covered topics that may be helpful to a person trying to find old information a lot easier as scrolling through the topics pane would allow you to quickly browse through the topics and categories they're in on the pane up top and clicking on one of them would take you to the detailed view of that topic in the pane below.</p>",

It's easy enough to find topics within a particular stream, but I occasionally find myself wanting a list of topics across all streams (but intelligently organized for me, like maybe allowing me to filter topics to just those I've sent messages to, etc.).</p>",

    {
        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"58\">@Steve Howell</span> Well i think I agree with you that certain more advanced filters would be interesting. I haven't used zulip extensively enough to really have an opinion on that but your suggestion sounds like it would be useful.</p>\n<p>I just meant that since the search results are already across different streams, they can occasionally be extremely cluttered. I have 2 thoughts here. I think that the notion of topics is probably one of the central points of the zulip experience. I don't believe though that in its current implementation its being leveraged as effectively as it could be. For example, when creating a new topic the search results within the topic headline are limited to the stream you're currently in. The counterpoint to this would be as a rule you should search first and create a topic later. That being the case, I've found the search results page itself is particularly uneasy on the eyes to parse, because the matches between topic names and keywords matches have not been separated. I believe as a front-end feature this would require a degree of effort less, and still be a useful feature. As a secondary suggestion, I believe it would be helpful if within the autocomplete dropdown while creating a new topic, results from other categories matching the keyword(s) were displayed below the primary results separated by some sort of design element. This would mean that a person would be more likely to spend the time to browse through zulip topics even if they are a new/less invested user. We could additionally add a hyperlink to the full search results page at the top of that autocomplete menu</p>",
