Instead of using checkboxes, maybe we can use a multiselect drop-down menu. This way, users can easily select multiple providers from a single menu.</p>\n<p>I would love to hear your thoughts on this suggestion and any other feedback you may have regarding this issue.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/fc/XiKuLBWqv9yh8riTqcRnqaC_/21914-R.mov\">21914-R.mov</a></p>",
