A little while ago, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"2187\">@Greg Price</span> filed an issue for show a tooltip with the emoji name on status emoji (<a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19821\">#19821</a>), and there's an in-progress PR. The main motivation is to make it possible to find out what the emoji is called, e.g. to be able to use it. Note also that Greg left a detailed comment <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/20138#issuecomment-1034276881\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>My intuition, perhaps shaped by my experience with emoji statuses in Slack at my previous job, was that the tooltip on the emoji should provide the status text, rather than the emoji name. Note that the status text is also included in the tooltip for the user's name in the left sidebar, but I think it can be a little hard to find there.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/4d/syma5DRDoaXPTjlhI2PniICW/Screen-Shot-2022-02-09-at-11.16.55-PM.png\">Screen-Shot-2022-02-09-at-11.16.55-PM.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/4d/syma5DRDoaXPTjlhI2PniICW/Screen-Shot-2022-02-09-at-11.16.55-PM.png\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2022-02-09-at-11.16.55-PM.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/4d/syma5DRDoaXPTjlhI2PniICW/Screen-Shot-2022-02-09-at-11.16.55-PM.png\"></a></div><p>Anyway, curious to hear what others think. :)</p>",
