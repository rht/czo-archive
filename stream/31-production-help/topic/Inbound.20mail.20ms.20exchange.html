<p>Has anyone setup inbound email with MS Exchange? That’s my goal today and I’m looking for any config detail that might be Exchange specific.</p>

<p>Yes, that’s what I’m going to try and get going. I’ll let you know the experience and document any exchange specific I find. </p>
<p>It looks like all the setup docs on this are based on comments of the settings.py. Am I missing any other info?</p>

<p>Yep, that's where it's documented.  We should probably move those to ReadTheDocs; the integration is pretty stable and thus hasn't had major work on it since before we even had ReadTheDocs.</p>

<p>So <code>/etc/sysconfig</code> is something I typically see on CentOS, not Ubuntu. This doesn't exist on my 16.04 install. Do I have to set some env variables before running zulip-puppet-apply?</p>
<p>I'm running this command based on the comments in the setup.py for configuring the email gateway local delivery option.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span># There are two ways to configure email mirroring in Zulip:
#  1. Local delivery: A MTA runs locally and passes mail directly to Zulip
#  2. Polling: Checks an IMAP inbox every minute for new messages.
#
# The local delivery configuration is preferred for production because
# it supports nicer looking email addresses and has no cron delay,
# while the polling mechanism is better for testing/developing this
# feature because it doesn&#39;t require a public-facing IP/DNS setup.
#
# The main email mirror setting is the email address pattern, where
# you specify the email address format you&#39;d like the integration to
# use.  It should be one of the following:
#   %s@zulip.example.com (for local delivery)
#   username+%s@example.com (for polling if EMAIL_GATEWAY_LOGIN=username@example.com)
EMAIL_GATEWAY_PATTERN = &quot;%s@zulip.eng.nimblestorage.com&quot;
#
# If you are using local delivery, EMAIL_GATEWAY_PATTERN is all you need
# to change in this file.  You will also need to enable the Zulip postfix
# configuration to support local delivery by adding
#   , zulip::postfix_localmail
# to puppet_classes in /etc/zulip/zulip.conf and then running
# `scripts/zulip-puppet-apply -f` to do the installation.

<p>We use <code>puppet</code> to install/upgrade the configuration of various dependencies.</p>

<p>And it would appear that <code>puppet</code> is somehow incorrectly detecting your system as not an Ubuntu system and thus trying to look for RHEL/CentOS configuration files.  I don't think the issue is in any code that we wrote; so it's likely some sort of interaction between puppet defaults and something on your system.  Probably the fix for Zulip will be to add some sort of override option, but we need to debug more to figure this out.</p>

<p>The temporary failure messages may be able to tell you more about what the failure is.  If you don't see anything in <code>/var/log/mail.log</code>, then the mail isn't getting to Postfix, so your problem is at a higher level, or before that (e.g. your MX is not configured, or port 25 is blocked on your host)</p>

<p>Oh, hm:</p>

<p>I'm running Postfix server with google account ID as Relay for outgoing emails</p>

<p>Zulip wants to configure your Postfix to accept the incoming emails.  Do if that's a manual configuration, that's not likely to work out of the box. <br>
 Did you run <code>/home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/zulip-puppet-apply</code>?  If you run that again, does it show any changes it would want to apply?</p>

<p>Your topic also mentions "MS Exchange" -- did you just pick a pre-existing topic that had some reference to incoming email, or is Exchange also somehow involved?</p>
