<p>After setting up my organisation on <a href="http://zulipchat.com">zulipchat.com</a> and logging in on mobile, I unsubscribed from "core team", thinking I would only be unsubscribed on my mobile device so that I would not be bothered with notifications there. Instead the whole stream appears to have been removed from my view, even though I am the instance administrator, maybe it was entirely deleted because I was the only member so far. Is there a way to restore it?</p>

<p>You should be able to click the little settings symbol next to "STREAMS", select "all streams" and rejoin the stream.</p>
<p>You can configure push notifications in your Settings</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="15808">@Felix (strifel)</span>! I have already checked there. The "core team" stream that was automatically created when I created the instance is not visible there anymore.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="12320">@Dennis Schridde</span> any user who's still on the stream can add you; if there are none, it's been deactivated and you'll likely need to find it in the "deactivated streams" UI.</p>

<p>What UI did you use to unsubscribe?  We have plans on the webapp to add a warning before doing so, but it sounds like maybe you did this on mobile?  </p>
<p>In any case <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="2187">@Greg Price</span> we should open an issue to track the webapp-side issue.</p>

<p>Yes, I was using mobile. # &gt; All Streams, and then I flipped the switch on the "core team" stream.</p>

<p>Where do I find that "deactivated streams" UI? In the webapp I looked into gear menu &gt; "manage streams" , but only find "subscribed" and "all streams". In gear menu &gt; "manage organisation" I find "deactivated users" and "default streams", but not "deactivated streams".</p>
