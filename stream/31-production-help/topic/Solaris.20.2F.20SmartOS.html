<p>Not really a help question but more of an production FYI for anyone thats interested; We're currently running Zulip on SmartOS (Illumos / Solaris). Took some manual installation but it works really nice!</p>

<p>Should probably add thats it's kinda hard to do a write-up of it because it's build with Packer, SaltStack, Terraform and integrated with the rest of our (specific) infra like Consul, Vault, etc. So it's really adjusted to our specific setup but if anyone has questions about a SmartOS / Triton deployment give me a ping.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-email="jasper@siepkes.nl" data-user-id="2584">@Jasper Siepkes</span> cool!  If there are small tweaks to our install scripts that would make that sort of thing less messy, we'd definitely take PRs.  </p>
<p>(I guess you may also want to try to debug at least the upgrade process, since that's something you'll be doing more than once)</p>
