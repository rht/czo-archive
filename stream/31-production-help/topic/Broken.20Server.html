<p>Hi, I am using Zulip on Droplet server. I upgraded Ubuntu and now my entire server has crashed. We are a fully voluntary non-profit organisation using Zulip to communicate with all of our volunteers and I am clearly out of my depth! Should I revert back to backup from 6 days ago?</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>/home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/upgrade-zulip-from-git 7.x

<p>I then realised the 7.x so I replaced it with 7.2</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>/home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/upgrade-zulip-from-git 7.2

<p>Interesting that it fixed push notifications -- that, I don't have any theories on, since the issue seemed to have been networking in some form, for you.</p>
<p>You can drop something in <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/zulip">https://github.com/sponsors/zulip</a> if you're so inclined (there's a non-recurring option tucked in there), but it's absolutely not necessary or expected.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="27597">@Daniel Hammocks</span> Glad things are fixed! One thought on how the upgrade may have fixed the push notifications issue: the upgrade procedure will have included a restart of all the Zulip server processes. If one of those had gotten into a bad state somehow, then the restart could have fixed that.</p>
<p>Given that we don't know of a relevant code change we've made recently that would have affected this, that restart seems fairly likely as the step that fixed the push notifications.</p>

<p>In general if your Zulip server is behaving in a bad way where it seems like a restart might get it back to working, you can always restart it with the <code>scripts/restart-server</code> script as described here:<br>
<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/settings.html#making-changes">https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/settings.html#making-changes</a></p>
<p>(Though that <em>shouldn't</em> be necessary in general — it should only be needed when you've made some configuration change and need the server processes to pick up that change. So if you do find yourself repeatedly needing to do restarts outside that context, then we'd be interested in hearing about it so we can try to debug.)</p>

<p>@Greg I did try restarting all the services and then a full reboot of the server when I first started getting the error messages. As well as following the push notification guide to try and re-register the service. Not sure if that helps in any way? But I’m just glad it’s fixed. Thank you for all your help.</p>

<p>Hmm. That is informative ­— thanks for the update!</p>
<p>I guess another thing is that you mentioned at the top of this thread that you were upgrading Ubuntu, the operating system. Did that perhaps involve rebooting the machine? Perhaps something was wedged at the system level, or otherwise outside of Zulip's own processes that <code>scripts/restart-server</code> restarts, and so the reboot is what unwedged it.</p>
