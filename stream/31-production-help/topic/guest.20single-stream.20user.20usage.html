<p>We have a number of departments that have workstudies or interns working alongside employees.  Is setting them up as single-stream guest users an appropriate use of that license type?  Are guest users able to participate in 1-to-1 and group PMs in addition to their single assigned stream?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="15619">@Jeremy Bascom</span> yes, they can participate fully in PMs.</p>

<p>It depends on your organization's model for interns; some folks would have them as normal members.</p>

<p>But the intended use case for "guests" in our current model is temporary folks like contractors who might not be a full member of the organization, and I could see a company classifying their interns that way.</p>
