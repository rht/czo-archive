<p>Hi, <br>
We are using vtigercrm in my company and over the years tapped into it's MySQL database with VBA Access tools (via ODBC) and vb.NET tools to add functionality. Now it's pretty firmly integrated into the life of our company. We deal with users, projects and tasks and we were hoping to also tap into Zulips postgres database in order to assign streams of clients automatically to users when they have been assigned a corresponding task or project. <br>
So far I was able to install postgres ODBC and open the Zulip tables in Access or DBeaver. But because Zulip seems to make good use of triggers I couldn't manipulate the data in the tables (ie. make a user inactive from outside of Zulip).<br>
Customer related streams should only be visible if the employees actually deals with them and if someone sends a ticket about a technical issue it should also assign a corresponding stream in Zulip. For our HR department we were hoping to create Zulip and vtigercrm users from our vb.NET tool. When an employee leaves we would like to deactivate their various user accounts at the click of a button. <br>
Can this be done?</p>
