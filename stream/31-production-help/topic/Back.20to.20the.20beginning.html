<p>Ok, I've been running Zulip for few months now, and I am ready to start implementing bots. After several idiotic mistakes, I finally think I have the boilerplate bot ready to run. Unfortunately, I'm getting an SSL error, which brings me back to the beginning production install, during which I glossed over the ssl cert step.</p>
<p>I am trying to follow the certbot "manual" instructions linked from the Zulip help docs (my server does not live on the public internet): <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#manual">https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#manual</a></p>
<p>It looks like I need to place a file in /.well-known/acme-challenge/, but I am not finding that directory in the expected places: /var/www/example or /usr/share/nginx/html. Into which directory for Zulip should this file go?</p>
<p>I am assuming with the above that the error I now get when running zulip-run-bot</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Python"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">ERROR</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">SSL</span> <span class="n">ERROR</span>

<span class="n">Have</span> <span class="n">you</span> <span class="n">started</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">server</span><span class="err">?</span>
<span class="n">Or</span> <span class="n">did</span> <span class="n">you</span> <span class="n">misspecify</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">URL</span><span class="err">?</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Is because I have not set up SSL correctly in the first place...</p>

<p>Aaaaaand this was the solution that worked for me: <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/certificates-for-localhost/">https://letsencrypt.org/docs/certificates-for-localhost/</a>  and <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/master/puppet/zulip/files/nginx/zulip-include-common/certbot">https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/master/puppet/zulip/files/nginx/zulip-include-common/certbot</a></p>
<p>Basically, unless you spoof by having a .com or .org registered domain pointing to a local IP, and then generate a cert for the .com or .whatever, you can't really use certbot, even on manual mode. But, you can make a cert and key with openssl and add it to your certificate store authority.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="16790">@Matt Hall</span> interesting; where would you recommend we update the documentation to help the next person with this issue?</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="7">@Tim Abbott</span> ,</p>
<p>For the SSL cert part of the install, I really sent myself on a wild goose chase. I found the subject pretty tough to figure out, and the help I got on <a class="stream" data-stream-id="31" href="/#narrow/stream/31-production-help">#production help</a>  really helped a lot. I think copying (or re-writing, to avoid plagiarism the info from the letsencrypt link would be helpful. I am running Zulip on a Debian tower. Putting the zulip-combined-crt into /usr/local/share/ca-certificates and then running sudo update-ca-certificates got rid of the SSL error when running the bot script. Mozilla still tells me that the connection is untrusted, but I gave up on getting the browser to accept the self-signed cert awhile ago.</p>
<p>So, I guess some information about manually putting the certificate in that path might be helpful, too?</p>
