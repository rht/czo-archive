<p>Just noting this issue here (see topic name) that was reported in April because it recently had a <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/21783#issuecomment-1645068557">work around posted as a comment</a>, but I hadn't seen anyone from the community respond to the issue in GitHub.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/21783#issue-1202865775">Original issue comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There appears to be an issue with Importing messages, emojis, etc. for users that dont exist anymore. In my use case there are messages from users that dont exist in the rocketchat database anymore and as far as i can tell this collides in multiple areas during the import as the script tries to look up the id/name of the user corresponding to the message, but cannot find the user as they dont exist in the user dict.</p>
