<p>Even as admin, I cannot add subscribers to private streams I'm not myself subscribed to. I can remove everyone, but cannot add anyone. IMO this is inconsistent behaviour, especially for admin accounts, which should have full control over every stream or none at all.</p>

<p>This is consistent behavior, with the rule "Administrators cannot access private message or private stream content unless an existing subscriber adds them".  </p>
<p>We are considering adding a feature to allow "Organization owners", a new concept in 3.0, to change the rules for how private streams work; since there's definitely organizations for whom that preference doesn't make sense.</p>

<p>Okay, thank you for explaining the reasoning behind this decision, I get it now. Nevertheless, it does not really make sense to give admins the permission to remove subscribers from streams they're [the admins] not subscribed to.</p>

<p>Agreed, I don't think we should allow that under the current model, though it doesn't seem  super harmful</p>

<p>The plan here, for context, is to add a "Stream admin" role that can help fill in the gaps here; that will definitely be in 4.0.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>just to follow up: we're running Zulip 5.5 and there is no role "stream admin" yet. Is this supposed to be a global role like "Moderator" or "Administrator"? IMO the most logical way would be to implement this on a per-stream basis, so no one is a Stream Admin for more then their own streams. But as of version 5.5 creators of streams cannot  unsubscribe people from their own streams unfortunately...</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="16782">@Christoph</span> we ended up moving away from the original stream administrator plan (which was going to be per-stream) in favor of using user groups.
