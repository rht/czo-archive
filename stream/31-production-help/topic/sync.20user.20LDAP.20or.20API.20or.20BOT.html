<p>Hi, I'm learning zullip since yesterday cause we want to deploy one with multiple realm in our enterprise. <br>
I analyse the functionality of the authentication from your doc because we want a sync between our existing and our future zullip serv.<br>
Our enterprise have multiple organisation with multiple subdomains on our web app. example : <a href="http://org1.enterprise.com" target="_blank" title="http://org1.enterprise.com">org1.enterprise.com</a> and <a href="http://org2.enterprise.com" target="_blank" title="http://org2.enterprise.com">org2.enterprise.com</a> .</p>
<p>We want to make the same with zulip something like <a href="http://org1.zulip.enterprise.com" target="_blank" title="http://org1.zulip.enterprise.com">org1.zulip.enterprise.com</a> and <a href="http://org2.zulip.enterprise.com" target="_blank" title="http://org2.zulip.enterprise.com">org2.zulip.enterprise.com</a> .</p>
<p>We also have and LDAP, dc=enterprise,dc=com , in this we have our organization o=org1 and o=org2, we have specific user in each org. <br>
I searched about a way in the doc to specify the realm of zulip in the AUTH_LDAP_USER_SEARCH something like </p>
<p>AUTH_LDAP_USER_SEARCH = LDAPSearch("o=%(realm),dc=enterprise,dc=com",<br>
                                   ldap.SCOPE_SUBTREE, "(uid=%(user)s)")</p>
<p>But I didn't find anything like this. Is this a way of doing something like this ?</p>
<p>If we can't, we searched another solution and we found the api.<br>
We can't create user via api and I saw by searching her,  we can delete them by api too (it's not in the doc ) by DELETE /users/idUser .<br>
My question is can we modify it by api ? Coz sometimes we change username or password of our user in our app and we want to impact the zulip account to. </p>
<p>If it's not possible we thought about a bot "API super bot (self-hosted only)",  but doesn't found a lot of doc about it ... Can he create, update and delete user via the API of our app ? <br>
Because I saw this "Send content to and from another product." and this "Automate tasks a human user could do."  so I suppose a bot can connect with our API to get the update of our user and impact the user on the zulip server.</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestion ?<br>
Thanks a lot for your time.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="13499">@Mike Delicata</span> there isn't built-in support for that sort of thing, but we can make it work for you as part of an enterprise support contract.</p>
