<p>Hi :)<br>
A user is wondering whether it is possible to also receive notification mails when one is online. (He says he likes email.) As far as I know, this is not currently possible, right?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="17322">@Robert (ro-i)</span> can you get a bit more thoughts from the user on how they're intending to use Zulip with that model?  E.g. do they really want to get an email for every private message in an active conversation they're having with someone in Zulip?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="7">@Tim Abbott</span> Sorry, I forgot to forward the answer of the user... <span aria-label="eyes" class="emoji emoji-1f440" role="img" title="eyes">:eyes:</span> <br>
He said that his thoughts are similar to those of <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="17945">@Wesley Aptekar-Cassels</span>.<br>
He wants to use his INBOX as TODO system (and mailbox as knowledge base). Basically, he likes to have some kind of "email bridge", so ideally, he wants to see everything that's going on on Zulip also in his mailbox. He also added a link to <a href="https://xkcd.com/1782/">https://xkcd.com/1782/</a> and pointed out that such an email integration would also help him to reduce the "entry cost"  since he could participate (at least rudimentary) from a system he is already using.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="17322">@Robert (ro-i)</span> thanks; I've updated the issue to mark it as something that we'd like to build, since we've gotten similar feedback from a few people in the last few weeks.  (It's not hard; the main cost is the UI clutter of having another setting).</p>
