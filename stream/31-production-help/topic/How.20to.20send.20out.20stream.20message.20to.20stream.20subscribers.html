<p>Hello,<br>
I have a general question on how to send out stream messages to stream subscribers' email addresses. <br>
Our server has configured to run as a SMTP mail server. <br>
I also have added SETTING_EMAIL_HOST: "localhost" and SETTING_EMAIL_GATEWAY_PATTERN: "%s@abc.edu"<br>
However, I never receive any stream messages from zulip. <br>
Have I missed any other configurations?<br>
Or is there any log files that I can read any errors about this issue?<br>
(there is no recorded in both email_deliverer.log and send_email.log )<br>
Ps: however zulip administrator receives stream message.<br>
Thank you so much. :)</p>

<p>When I ran send test email script, I got the following error. </p>

<p>However, I still get the same error. <br>
Does anyone have any suggestions for this type of error?<br>

<p>Hi Alex,<br>
Thank you so much for taking the time to reply to my message. <br>
I really appreciate your help. <br>
After I changed SETTING_EMAIL_HOST to 127.0.0.1, I got a different error message. <br>
The message is ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 111] Connection refused<br>
Looks like maybe I have incorrect port number for SETTING_EMAIL_PORT which I use port 25. <br>
Do I need to use different port number since we use zulip docker container?<br>
Also, I have removed  SETTING_ADD_TOKENS_TO_NOREPLY_ADDRESS: "False".<br>
Or do you think that SETTING_EMAIL_USE_SSL: "True" should be false?</p>
<p>Thank you so much again. :)</p>

<p>If you're using the Docker container, your mailserver is not in the container, so neither <code>127.0.0.1</code> nor <code>localhost</code> is going to work.  You'll need to put in the name of the host which is running the mailserver.</p>
<p><code>SETTING_EMAIL_USE_SSL</code> and <code>SETTING_EMAIL_PORT </code> depend on how you've configured your email server.</p>

<p>Our system admin has configurated the local server as a SMTP server. It will send out message; however , it wouldn't be able to receive any email. <br>
Does that mean I need to use the gateway that he gave it to me to put in SETTING_EMAIL_HOST? <br>
Such as SETTING_EMAIL_HOST: "<a href="http://gateway.abc.com">gateway.abc.com</a>"?<br>
He also mentioned to me that the port number is 25 and the local SMTP_SSL is yes.<br>
Do I use the same parameters for the docker container or they will be different?</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your message again. :)</p>

<p>The answers to those questions depend on where the Docker container is running, how you've configured Docker networking, and how you've configured the local mailserver.  I don't think we can help with those details.</p>

<p>You can see if <code>host.docker.internal</code> works as the hostname instead of <code>127.0.0.1</code>, as a first try.</p>

<p>Alex,<br>
Thank you so much again. <br>
I tried to use docker0 gateway in SETTING_EMAIL_HOST: "172.17.0.1", but that didn't work. <br>
However, I was able to make it to work by using SMTP gateway that was given to me by our system admin. <br>
I was able to send test email by using send_test_email command. </p>
<p>My next question is that do you know how I can let zulip streams to send posted messages to my email inbox?<br>
I have enabled the email notification on zulip stream, but I just don't receive any message from my zulip.</p>
<p>Do I still miss any other configurations? <br>
Thank you so much. Again I am using zulip docker container.</p>

<p>To be more precise, it will send them if you're logged in but have been idle for a while. See <a href="https://zulip.com/help/email-notifications#delay-before-sending-emails">https://zulip.com/help/email-notifications#delay-before-sending-emails</a> for details on how this works.</p>

I will give it a try. Thank you so much for your help. :)</p>
