<p>Hello all! I've got an old version of Zulip (1.3.8) and the decision has been made to bring it out of development to production tier. However, looking at the documentation for upgrading, it looks like it isn't going to be easy. If I understand it correctly, the export/import tools won't do me any good as I have to import  to the same version of Zulip. Upgrading the existing server seems likely to be very painful as there are database changes, and I guess I'd have to modify the schema and just keep trying til it worked. Are there any other options I have? Are the database changes likely to happen in future releases (meaning this would have to be done again)?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="9893">@Mike Ray</span> upgrading should be relatively painless. Have you seen the documentation at <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/maintain-secure-upgrade.html" target="_blank" title="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/maintain-secure-upgrade.html">https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/maintain-secure-upgrade.html</a>?</p>
<p>Since 1.3.8 was quite a while ago, I would recommend 1.3.8 -&gt; 1.4, then doing 1.4 -&gt; 1.5, etc. But each upgrade should involve downloading a tarball and running a single command. The upgrade command takes care of the database changes automatically.</p>
<p>(And you're correct that export/import won't work here.)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="131">@Rishi Gupta</span> - Thanks for the advice. I had read the documentation, but was concerned by the note:<br>
| Note that upgrading an existing Zulip production server from Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty to Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial (or 16.04 Xenial to 18.04 Bionic) will require significant manual intervention on your part to migrate the data in the database from Postgres 9.3 to Postgres 9.5.<br>
But I didn't think about upgrading the existing server to 1.8.1 (with incremental steps between) but leaving the OS alone. I'll try that tomorrow -- thanks for the advice.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="131">@Rishi Gupta</span>  - Even if upgrading the existing server to 1.8.1 works out, what happens when that OS is EoL? Are distro upgrades always going to require extensive manual intervention? Do people basically now just do a fresh install and lose chat history to upgrade the OS?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="9893">@Mike Ray</span> for OS upgrades (which are sorta independent of Zulip upgrades in terms of when you can run them), you just have to go through postgres's standard documented process for turning a postgres 9.3 database into a postgres 9.5 database.</p>

<p>(Or whatever the versions are for the base OSes in question)</p>

<p>Got it. Thanks for the feedback!</p>
