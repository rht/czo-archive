<p>Hello! I am trying to help my business get internal approval for Zulip's use within our global IT organizations. We are made up of many small and large teams, and while Zulip's current authentication methods should be sufficient for my particular department, another one of our departments requires Multi Factor authentication. The business requires internally hosted servers for each department and cloud hosting is not an option. My team works almost entirely on our business's network or via VPN, however  another particular department wants to integrate Zulip not only with the internal development team, but sales personnel who are not able to VPN into the network easily during travels.  </p>
<p>Is there a multifactor authentication method available or a recommended solution for this for Zulip? The other team likes this option from Mattermost which can be found here: <a href="https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/auth.html" target="_blank" title="https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/auth.html">https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/auth.html#</a> and I am looking for something similar on Zulip.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="5575">@Chris S</span> there's actually an open PR for 2FA that's likely going in very soon.</p>

<p>You can also of course use an existing MFA solution with SSO and configure Zulip's "REMOTE_USER SSO" auth backend</p>
