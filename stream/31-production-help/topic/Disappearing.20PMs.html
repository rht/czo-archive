<p>Hi :) I have a user reporting a really strange problem. He gets notification mails from our Zulip server because of new PMs. But then, he cannot find those PMs after logging in. Neither in the iOS-App, nor in the Mac-App, nor in the browser. It is as if the PM had never been written.<br>
This issue appeared now for multiple times.<br>
Please consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's not that PMs generally do not work for this user. We communicated via PM and it worked fine.</li>
<li>The user is trustworthy, so he does not make fun of me.</li>
<li>The problematic messages all come from foreign first-time users (new students from different countries).</li>
<li>He did not mute those users.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you have any idea what could be going on?</p>

<p>Is it possible that the user has multiple accounts, and the PMs were sent to a different account than the one to which the user is logged in?</p>

<p>Oh yeah! He has indeed two accounts! That was the problem. Thank you so much, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="699">@Anders Kaseorg</span> <span aria-label="thumbs up" class="emoji emoji-1f44d" role="img" title="thumbs up">:thumbs_up:</span> </p>
<p>This reminds me that I really need to bother <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="7">@Tim Abbott</span> again with <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/16208">the PR from <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="15808">@Felix (strifel)</span></a> which would build the foundation for my PR to enhance the SAML authentication.<br>
Because this is a really annoying problem for our users: Our university does not use the primary email address as persistent identifier. So people can easily change their primary email address. But if they forget to change it withing Zulip <strong>first</strong>, they always get a new account...</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="17322">@Robert (ro-i)</span> thanks for the reminder.  I'm super super swamped right now but we should be able to find a time to integrate that this year.</p>
