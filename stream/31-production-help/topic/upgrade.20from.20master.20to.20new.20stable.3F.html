<p>Hi!<br>
I have set up a zulip server on a virtual private server for a small research group. To be able to import a server previously running on <a href="http://zulip.com">zulip.com</a>, I upgraded to master, as recommended <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/export-and-import.html">here</a>. I successfully imported, and all is running fine.<br>
My question: I installed and upgraded to master on September 11, and version 3.2 was <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/releases">released on September 15</a>. Is it (a) possible (b) recommended to update to the new release from master?<br>
My goal is to have a stable installation that requires as little maintaing as possible.</p>

<p>We only support an upgrade from <code>master</code> to a stable release if your <code>master</code> commit is from before the stable release was branched. <code>3.x</code> was branched from <code>master</code> with the release of 3.0 on July 16. So you’ll need to wait for 4.0.</p>

<p>Got it, thanks a lot! I'll wait for 4.0 then.</p>
