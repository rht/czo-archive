Zulip installation failed (exit code 1)!

The install process is designed to be idempotent, so you can retry after resolving whatever issue caused the failure (there should be a traceback above). A log of this installation is available in /var/log/zulip/install.log

<p>The issue seems to be that supervisor is not active/enabled but I see no reason why it can't start. I have pretty much nothing on the system except universe and wget. Do I need to install something? I have just installed zulip server exactly as it says on the docs.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="16534">@ReCore</span> it looks like all services are failing to start, not just supervisord.  </p>
<p>Since you're installing on an unsupported platform, you're going to need to do some debugging by looking at logs (etc.).</p>

<p>The issue you are probably running into is that Docker containers don’t run systemd. If you’re trying to build your own Docker container for Zulip, you might want to look at <a href="https://github.com/zulip/docker-zulip">https://github.com/zulip/docker-zulip</a> instead.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="7">@Tim Abbott</span> <br>
If docker is not supported to run the regular server, what are the supported platforms? I have tried vagrant but I can't seem to get the Vagrantfile working and I thought it was just a container inside a docker container anyway. What else do you support? <br>
I also don't really want to use the docker image because I do plan on changing the css for my organisation and I would also like to see how the server works, which is a fair bit harder with a docker image.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="16534">@ReCore</span> read the docs for our Docker image -- you can use custom CSS (etc.) with it by just building the image from your fork.</p>

<p>Yes but it is much simpler to use a normal server. And I can see how that works. I can't really see how the docker image works.</p>

<p>I was unable to get that to connect to any form internet (wifi or ethernet) and apparently every single thing online says it can't connect to the internet. Either I am doing something very wrong with it or you somehow managed to connect it.</p>

<p>Who would go to all the trouble of developing a container system that can’t connect to the internet? Of course it can connect to the internet.</p>

<p>Huh. <br>
Ok yeah I just had a look around for proof that it is not meant to. I got nothing. Not sure where I got that idea from. I'll continue trying with LXD. Thanks.</p>
