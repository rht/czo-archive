<p>Hi, hoping someone can help.</p>
<p>I am trying to connect a new installation of the Zulip Desktop Client - Windows version, to our on-premise Zulip server and receiving the error <strong>"[url] does not appear to be a valid Zulip server. [Check you can browse to it/Do you use a proxy/Is it a zulip server/Does it have a valid certificate]"</strong></p>
<p>I can browse to it from the laptop without issue, we don't use any proxies, obviously it's a zulip server as browsing works and the SSL certificate is valid. I've also tried adding Zulip as an exception within the laptop's firewall. Other computers on the same network are using the desktop client without a problem...</p>
<p>What's next to try? Thanks</p>

<p>Hi, I found that the cause was Azure AD Connect... I'm not sure which specific setting yet but I was having other networking issues and as soon as I have de-linked the user account Zulip worked.</p>
