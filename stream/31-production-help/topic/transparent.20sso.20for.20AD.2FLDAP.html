<p>I'm trying to figure out how to make zulip as accessible as possible for new users on a company intranet where all the clients are AD integrated windows machines. For our Discourse forum I found this wonderfully simple IIS SSO provider where you can delegate the task of identifying users to any random IIS server on your network: <a href="https://github.com/laktak/discourse-sso" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/laktak/discourse-sso">https://github.com/laktak/discourse-sso</a> but it is going to take some effort to adapt it to work with zulip.  The other method I will try is to get auth_kerb working in Apache and use the REMOTE_USER SSO method in zulip. I would love to hear how others have solved this. Authenticating through LDAP might not seem like a big deal but I think automatically logging in my users would encourage them to actively use a new service like zulip.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-email="ssvenn@gmail.com" data-user-id="4209">@Sverre Svenningsen</span> the REMOTE_USER SSO approach provides the user experience you describe without any code changes, so I'd try out the <code>auth_kerb</code> approach first if I were you.  If you have good luck with either approach, I'd love some notes on any issues you ran into that we can use to extend the documentation.</p>
