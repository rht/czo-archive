<p>Hi. I have an urgent case, our chat server is down due to an expired LetsEncrypt certifcate<br>
I did get warning e-mails from LE, but ignored them as I thought that auto-renewing should do its job<br>
Our server started a few years ago as 1.8.1 and only a month ago I was able to upgrade it to 2.1.8 (had various failures in the past that I couldn't figure out, I have little Unix or general sysadmin experience)<br>
I suppose the auto-renewal used to work until now (we've never had such problem so far), and was broken by the upgrade</p>
<p>I tried all the info I could find without success, the <code>setup-certbot</code> and <code>certbot-maybe-renew</code> scripts, even the <code>certbot-auto renew</code> command as called by <code>certbot-maybe-renew</code> but without --quiet<br>
All these seem to do nothing and not even print anything important or anything at all<br>
And the files in <code> /etc/letsencrypt/live/&lt;hostname&gt;</code> remain unchanged<br>
I see the files are actually symlinks to <code>../../archive</code> and there I see there are already 19 copies of each file, the latest ones from July 31 (just 3 months ago)</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>I see here mentions of the <code>certbot</code> command, but I don't have it installed, should I install and try to run that?</p>

<p>I suspect it's possible your problem is an indirect result of being on a very old version; are you running Ubuntu 16.04?  It's very possible the version of <code>certbot</code> in that Ubuntu release no longer works.</p>

<p>So I'd consider doing <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-from-ubuntu-16-04-xenial-to-18-04-bionic">https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-from-ubuntu-16-04-xenial-to-18-04-bionic</a> as my next step -- Ubuntu 16.04 has basically reached EOL and you need to do it anyway, and I think there's probably a 50% chance that said upgrade fixes your problem.</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick answer. <br>
Yes, I tried running the cron command manually, doesn't print or do anything<br>
Ubuntu is 18.04, I was forced to upgrade to it by Zulip 2 (that was one of the upgrade problems)</p>

<p>Or even <code>certbot-auto</code> directly, as I extracted it from certbot-maybe-renew:<br>

<p>From the other topic I learned to look at <code>/var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log</code>, there I see the only few lines are from 2021-09-21 and the result was <code>Cert not yet due for renewal</code></p>

<p>LE only tries to renew a month(?) before expiration. Are you sure the issue is tied to the upgrade, and not something that broke sometime in the three months ago to one month ago window?</p>

<p>My vague recollection is LE is smart enough to only send the emails if you haven't renewed a month before expiry, at which point if your LE install is working correctly it would have renewed, so I think they're generally correct?</p>

<p>I'm not sure the issue is tied to the upgrade, but it's a pretty suspicious coincidence. The latest <code>letsencrypt.log</code> is from 09/21, the same day I did the upgrade, a month + 8 days before the certificate expired (today)</p>
<p>I started getting e-mails from LE definitely less than a month ago. Looking at my Trash I see one from 10/18 (11 days ago) and one from yesterday, though I think I had one more, maybe exactly a month before expiration (maybe Trash gets auto-cleaned)</p>
<p>Is it possible that after the expiration the certificate can no longer be updated, and a new one needs to be issued (don't know much about SSL certificates) ?</p>
<p>Should I try to upgrade <code>certbot-auto</code> ? Or maybe install <code>certbot</code> and try that?</p>

<p>My guess / very vague recollection is that maybe certbot-auto dated from when certbot was newish and people would want to install it directly. These days, I suspect the normal thing may be to grab it from your distro, so they may have gotten rid of certbot auto.</p>

<p>Have you tried running <code>apt-get update; apt-get upgrade</code> to pull in the new <code>ca-certificates</code> package with <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ca-certificates/+bug/1944481">this fix</a>? Not sure whether this is your problem, but it matches the time frame.</p>

<p>Thanks, I updated the packages</p>
<p>It turned out that <code>/usr/local/sbin/certbot-auto</code> was 0 bytes, I'm sorry I didn't notice that earlier. That's why it wouldn't do anything.<br>
And I guess it was empty because it was recently downloaded by <code>setup-certbot</code> from a no-longer existing URL<br>
I installed <code>certbot</code> following the instructions on its <a href="https://certbot.eff.org">site</a>, ran it with <code>renew</code> and all was fine, the server immediately worked</p>
<p>I guess my problem was caused by the too old Zulip version, maybe newer versions use a newer certbot distribution.<br>
I'll try to continue upgrading our Zulip to a fresher major version ASAP. I'm just a bit afraid after the headache I head moving from 1.8 to 2.x</p>

<p>I think I'm not going to try to fix the automatic renewal to match the new <code>certbot</code> command<br>
I hope it will be fixed by itself once Zulip is upgraded to a recent major version</p>

<p>Zulip 3 and later use <code>certbot</code> from the OS rather than <code>certbot-auto</code>.</p>
