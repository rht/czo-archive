<p>Hi folks,<br>
We are using Zulip since few years in my company and we are starting to use "generic" accounts for interns.<br>
When an intern leave the company we would like to delete all its private messages to avoid a new one reading them when he arrives.</p>
<p>Is it possible using zulip mechanism or should I have to script something ?</p>
<p>Thanks !</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="12755">@Unam</span> Hmm, might need to script something - there is the <code>delete_user</code> management command that cleans up user messages, but it does it while deleting the actual user - while it sounds like you want to re-use accounts <span aria-label="thinking" class="emoji emoji-1f914" role="img" title="thinking">:thinking:</span>  Is there a reason you need to actually re-use the generic accounts though? Wouldn't it be simpler (and perhaps safer?) to create a new generic account for each intern? (And old accounts can be deleted via <code>delete_user</code> as mentioned)</p>

<p>This is precisely a reason why account reuse is generally not suggested -- there are a large number of nooks and crannies you have to figure out how to clean out, otherwise you're potentially sharing all kinds of data.</p>
<p>I'd strongly counsel you to make each intern their own account.</p>
