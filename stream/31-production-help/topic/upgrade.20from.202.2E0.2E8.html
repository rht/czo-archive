<p>Hi <br>
I'm currently also trying to update a Zulip server from 2.0.8 to 2.1.0 and I'm running into an error where I can't access Zulip through the browser as it says err_connection_refused<br>
I have checked previous questions/solutions and they haven't helped much.<br>
From the logs it seems like <strong>TornadoQueueClient lost connection to RabbitMQ</strong> and <strong>[pika.adapters.utils.connection_workflow] AMQPConnector - reporting failure: AMQPConnectorSocketConnectError: ConnectionRefusedError(111, 'Connection refused')</strong> are my main issues but I have checked and the services are running.<br>
It's an Ubuntu 16.04 running Zulip 2.0.8, if possible I would want to update it to the latest 20.04 and Zulip 5.0</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="23962">@Erick</span> that error message suggests your RabbitMQ server isn't operational.</p>

<p>It may also be that rabbitmq is running, but the hostname has changed.  I don't recall if 2.0.8 had the fixes to pin the rabbitmq nodename.</p>
