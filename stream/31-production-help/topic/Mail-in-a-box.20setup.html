<p>I am new here and new to Zulip. I successfully installed a server. I would like to use Mail-in-a-box as my email server, because I already got one up and running for my organisation. But the <a href="mailto:noreply@abc.com">noreply@abc.com</a> is giving me some headaches. I am getting this error: <code>Sender address rejected: not owned by user zulip@abc.com</code> But I do not know how I can set this up. The main <a href="mailto:zulip@abc.com">zulip@abc.com</a> is no problem, the issue is with the "noreply@" I already asked in the MIAB support forum, but maybe there is someone here who has successfully used MIAB with Zulip?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="25129">@Max Baum</span> It’s entirely up to Mail-in-a-box whether it lets you send mail as <code>noreply@abc.com</code> when logged in as <code>zulip@abc.com</code>. Based on the <a href="https://mailinabox.email/advanced-configuration.html#relay">documentation</a>, you may be able to change this in Mail-in-a-box by creating a mail-forward alias for <code>noreply</code> that includes the <code>zulip</code> user in its permitted senders field. Or you can change <code>NOREPLY_EMAIL_ADDRESS</code> to match <code>EMAIL_HOST_USER</code> in the Zulip configuration.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>I guess, I was hoping, someone had already done it and could share their settings. <span aria-label="grinning face with smiling eyes" class="emoji emoji-1f601" role="img" title="grinning face with smiling eyes">:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:</span></p>
<p>I found a way now, although it feels a bit "hacky" by having two email users and each is an alias of the other and can send as the other.</p>
