<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="12073">@Pedro Barbosa</span> gear menu in upper right -&gt; manage streams. <br>
But in general the list of streams in the left sidebar is the set of streams you are subscribed to</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="131">@Rishi Gupta</span>.<br>
I was not very clear in my question. I mean other users, not me.</p>

<p>We don't provide an easy UI for seeing another user's subscriptions, though of course the data is all there in the API (at least for public streams).</p>

<p>As an multilingual organization administrator It has not been easy to manage which user (each of them speaking different languages) is subscribed correctly in the different stream languages I am planning to have. The difficulty is not concerning subscription that they can manage any time on stream settings. The difficult is to know who is going to be subscribed in what stream when we invite them or which stream (public or even private) the user is already subscribed to when we reactivate them.<br>
Any suggestion of workaround?</p>

<p>for each stream, you can see who is subscribed by going to manage streams. Does that help?</p>
