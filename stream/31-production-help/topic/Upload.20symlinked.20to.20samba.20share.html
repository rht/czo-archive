<p>I was wondering how zulip handled it when the upload folder is symlinked to a SMB mount.<br>
What would happen if that share is suddenly gone?<br>
What would be the performance hit since uploaded files need to be pulled through the network?<br>
I assume the links are in the database so only when you click a link the download might have more latency. Are the image previews loaded from db or the file?</p>

<p>I think this would behave like any other situation where the network drive disappeared or was not responsive. Likely you would see a hang until some kernel level IO timeout followed by retries. From the app perspective I would expect that would result in massive slow down as the uploads directory contains all the user avatars and files.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I would try to colocate the hosting of Zulip with the SMB server to reduce latency.</p>

<p>I don't think you need to use a symlink though. While <code>/home/zulip/uploads</code> is the default location you can change this in the <code>settings.py</code> to be the mount point of your samba share and avoid the symlink.</p>

<p>thanks, <br>
my reason for symlinking is because we are migrating an existing installation to a new server. I'm not sure if the paths are stored in the db as well. For Nextcloud I read that changing the data folder is only possible/recommended at install, not after.</p>

<p>I recently did a db dump and did not notice the path stored in the DB. I believe it's only read from the settings.py. Of course a symlink works regardless.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="6250">@Matthias</span> yeah, by design the <code>LOCAL_UPLOADS_DIR</code> path isn't stored in the database.  It should be possible to move that path and edit the configuration and have everything keep working.</p>

<p>(The paths we store in the DB are all relative to the root of <code>LOCAL_UPLOADS_DIR</code>)</p>
