<p>I liked the new design for the recipients bar, so I would like to have it on my server. How can I do that?<br>
Also, is there anything that I should know? Any problems/bugs/etc.?</p>

<p>There's a branch you can grab.  Today's a bit distracting, so remind me if you don't hear anything tomorrow, but basically you want the tabbott/recipient-bar-design branch.  There's some tweaks planned, but nothing broken.</p>

After some time that my Zulip server was unused, it will be used by a larger group of people!! <span class="emoji emoji-1f389" title="tada">:tada:</span></p>

<p>About the thing I asked above...<br>
Are there any special things that I need to take into consideration?</p>

<p>I think the main thing to note is that after some experimentation, we've gone back to the original recipient bars, that you see here. So tabbott/recipient-bar-design is no longer maintained.</p>
