<p>Hi,<br>
Is there a way I can tell when a user was added to a stream, and by whom?<br>
The Stream does not have a 'Stream Events' Topic.<br>
Operations via CLI is fine.<br>
Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="23987">@ebecaf</span> yes, there should be a <code>RealmAuditLog</code> entry recording the subscription. We don't currently have a UI for displaying that data, but you can access it via the management shell if you're sufficiently motivated.</p>
