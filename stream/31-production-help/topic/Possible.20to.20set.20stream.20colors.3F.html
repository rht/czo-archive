<p>I went and set consistent stream colors for all of our streams, only to discover that for any other user, the changes are not seen.  They appear to be local to me only.  Is there any way to set the stream colors for everyone?</p>

<p>No, we don't allow admins to have that level of control over its members.</p>

<p>Wow that's too bad.  We wanted to group things visually by color and now we can't.  It looks really silly with the rainbow.  Oh well.</p>

<p>We have plans to improve upon assigning colors logic so that colors are more consistent across org. <br>
See  <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/15078">#15078</a></p>

<p>They're currently assigned in sequence for a user's first 20 streams, which likely means two users joining with the same set of default streams will get the same colors.</p>

<p>That's a good start, but (for us anyway) it's less about them being consistent, and more about us being able to designate them.  We wanted to be able to color code different sections of our community and know that every member sees those same colors.  I suppose there's no harm in then allowing someone to alter the color choice if they really want to, but visually we'd really like to be able to separate sections with color.</p>
