<p>Is there a way to restrict what kinds of files are uploaded via the upload function in Zulip's message composer? Specifically, we want to make sure the users are unable to upload any executable code such as .js or .exe. Is this possible, or is it even a concern?</p>

<p>It's generally not a big concern, in that modern browsers generally warn users after downloading executable files from the Internet before letting them run them</p>

<p>(And if there were a concern, it would exist whether the files were uploaded or just linked to in any case)</p>

<p>I figured that would be the case, but I had promised I'd look into it. Thanks!</p>
