<p>Folks, I've created a new organization an I alread have all my old users migrated into there. Now I received a request from the CEO that I should restore all slack messages. I read that the current zulip tools is just supposed to be used in a new fresh installation, but I'm going to try this in a non fresh organization. </p>
<p>What kind of problems I can face with it? Should i do the slack backup restoring in the current organization or not?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="19558">@Iago Henrique Pires Moreira e Morais</span> the tool for importing data from Slack doesn't have a way to import it into an existing organization; it just creates a completely new organization.  The challenge with trying to import into an existing organization is that doing so creates all sorts of messy issues of identity (which users are the same), as you really don't want to create a bunch of semi-duplicate users during the import process.</p>
<p>(I don't think there's a sense in which you'll be able to actually try anything; you just need to pick whether you want to continue from the Slack import or you're new Zulip organization).</p>

<p>Hm, thanks for the answer!</p>

<p>It seems like it is a common use case where a team tries a test instance on <a href="http://zulipchat.com">zulipchat.com</a>, then once they have decided they want to migrate from Slack, they also want to export the history into <a href="http://zulipchat.com">zulipchat.com</a>. Maybe if the admin of the new Zulip can specify a json/csv file mapping the Slack username into the Zulip username when they email to <a href="mailto:support@zulip.com">support@zulip.com</a>, and then the Slack import script can rewrite the at mentions in the Slack messages with the pre-existing Zulip users?</p>

<p>I think it's something we could build, but it's a lot more subtle than that, since you also need to figure out whether to merge streams, etc.</p>

<p>If this can't be remedied in the short term, does this need stronger emphasis in the documentation?</p>

<p>I think it's documented pretty clearly that it creates a new organization.</p>

<p>Actually my thought process was the other way around - ie. if you might want to import, here's a warning that you need to start from scratch.</p>

<p>IIRC the Slack channels are imported into each topic in 1 channel? I don't see how there can be collision with Zulip streams and Slack channels. Also, the fact that the behavior is this way is not documented yet.</p>

<p>No, one slack channel =&gt; one Zulip stream is the default import mechanism, and you want that to import the subscriptions in a sane way.</p>

<p>Does that channel =&gt; stream behavior need to be documented in <a href="https://zulip.com/help/import-from-slack">https://zulip.com/help/import-from-slack</a> ?</p>

<p>I think it's the obvious thing; we do say we import Slack channels; if we did something different we would definitely need to talk about it.</p>
