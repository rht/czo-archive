<p>I think our intent at some point was to limit Guests to paid plans, but the technical restriction was never implemented.  We do generally offer major discounts to our paid plans for many use cases that aren't "all the users are employees", which depending on what you're doing, your use case may qualify for.</p>

<p>Deleted the original message by user request due to it having some information that was meant to be kept private (and there isn't a way to properly fix that without deleting the message). Here's the content of the revised message for context:</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>For cost reasons and because the amount of messages and users of our group is still very small I currently run a free Zulip Cloud instance. I just invited someone as a "Guest" user (the option was available in the select box in organisation settings). Now I read the "billing" part of the docs [1], which says that "Guests are only available on [...] on paid plans for Zulip Cloud".</p>
<p>Are the docs accurate, despite the config option being available on my free instance? What will happen with the user I invited? Will they still be able to access our instance? Is there an option to just "unlock" the guest user feature / pay for the guests, without having to pay for the other users?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,<br>
Dennis</p>
