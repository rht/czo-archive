<p>Can I enable responding to emails that are received via Zulip? So, when a person replies to the topic, it sends the message to the original sender?</p>

<p>That's only one-way</p>

<p>The other direction is controlled by people's notification settings, and the outgoing mail configuration: <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/email.html">https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/email.html</a></p>

<p>That's not what I want, though. The email that sends to the stream may not even be a user on the stream, so replying to such an email can't rely on notifications</p>

<p>Oh, I think I understand now -- sorry for not getting it earlier.  You mean if a random person on the internet uses a stream's incoming email address to send a message to a stream, is there any way of them getting replies on that stream via emails that Zulip sends them?</p>
<p>No, not currently.  I think there's a little security complication there, since forging emails isn't hard, and we don't want to send people emails for messages on a stream if they've not explicitly chosen to receive them.  There'd also need to be a way to show that the email address was "subscribed" to the stream, so people sending there would be aware of this extra semi-user that was getting their messages.</p>
<p>There's probably a model where we automatically make an account for the email address that sent in the message, and subscribe it to just that one stream with email notifications for it on -- but the user would certainly need a way to opt into those, which is pretty much tantamount to the regular account creation flow.</p>

<p>Thank you for the explanation! And no worries, I figure it wouldn't be a common desire.I see how you might see it as a security issue, but this would be more akin to opting into a Google Groups kind of functionality. Especially with how Google slowly culls down the usefulness of Google Groups, I think another platform adopting the whole "group behind an email" functionality is pretty important, and I think Zulip provides a great base for that.</p>
