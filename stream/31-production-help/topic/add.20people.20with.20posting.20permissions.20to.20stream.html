<p>It would be great, if it was possible to add specific people with fine-grained permissions to a stream. For example, a stream where only the admins of an organisation could post but if the need for another non-admin user occurs, they could be added with promoting them to organisational admin.</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for the quick reply. This is definitely a step in the right direction, but not quite, what I had in mind. The specified person should not be able to administrate the stream (or maybe so, but we want to able to give permissions for administration separately) but rather only to post things on said streams without admin privileges.</p>

<p>Is this in any way planned?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="16782">@Wurzelmann</span> that sort of thing is planned for once we've implemented the stream administrator role.</p>

<p>We're doing it as a new <code>role</code> field that will allow with relative ease future features like a stream-level moderator (which might be what you have in mind here).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="10242">@Sahil Batra</span> FYI just to make sure you're thinking about this when working on your PR; we should be careful to encode the <code>role</code> in a way that lets us add more roles conveniently.</p>
