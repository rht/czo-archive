<p>Went through the setup guide, using 16.04, received the notice that Upstart needed to be removed, uninstalled it and completed the installation. Everything worked fine until I rebooted. It would not boot up since I uninstalled Upstart. I thought systemd was installed as default, but it does not give me the option on advanced boot. I searched Google for removing upstart and keeping systemd but they all assumed systemd was default. I am running this under ESX6i. Hopefully something simple!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-email="thedazuru@gmail.com" data-user-id="2940">@DaZuru</span> that's puzzling; the <code>systemd</code> package in 16.04 is tagged as required, aka it shouldn't be possible to install a Debian/Ubuntu system without it.</p>

<p>Are you sure removing Upstart is related to why your machine isn't booting?</p>

<p>Yes sir. I went back to a snapshot to test. It shows that systemd is installed, when I tried to install it. I am a novice to grub and linux booting. Not sure why it would not be an option unless something in VMWare is causing it? Is it a UEFI issue?</p>

<p>I don't know much about VMWare, but you could try just deleting that line from the Zulip installer and installing with Upstart installed.  If I recall correctly, the main problem with Upstart being installed is it causes some other service like<code>nginx</code> to not start, which may be solvable another way.</p>

<p>But I wouldn't expect upstart to be particularly relevant at the <code>UEFI/grub</code> layer.</p>

<p>FWIW we've never heard of an issue with removing upstart before; I'd try googling for things like "remove upstart ESX6i boot" to see if you can find anyone else with the same issue.</p>

<p>Will do! Thanks for pointing me in another direction. My Google searches were bringing up the same pages. :)</p>

<p>Thanks for your help on this. I got it working by disabling the line that checks for Upstart. You were correct in that it caused nginx to not start. I think I found the reason why, I needed to copy and name my certs to match the zulip.enterprise file in sites-available. I used sudo nginx -t and figured it was a config error. Hopefully this will help with the upstart check issue?</p>
