<p>Is it considered safe to host the uploads directory (<code>/home/zulip/uploads</code>) on an NFS share? Our production directory is getting pretty large, and we'd like to offload it to a dedicated storage server.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="13263">@ncc</span> that should be safe, yes.  We don't do anything crazy with the filesystem access for hosting uploads.</p>

<p>thanks - do you know offhand if an issue with the share would cause zulip to hang as a whole or just attachment uploads/views to fail? going to test it myself as well</p>

<p>I think a priori it would cause those operations to fail or hang as appropriate, and if enough processing got stuck in that state, I suppose that could cause the overall server fail.</p>
