<p>I've gone through all sorts of weird issues trying to get hubot set up and integrated with zulip. Now I have the hubot end sorted, but following the instructions here: <a href="https://talk.translightbulb.org/integrations/doc/hubot">https://talk.translightbulb.org/integrations/doc/hubot</a> (npm install --save hubot-zulip) I get an error saying that package isn't available. Any alternative sources/updates for this?</p>

<p>The hubot-zulip package is still available. Can you copy and paste the exact error message rather than paraphrasing it?</p>
<p>However, Hubot upstream has been <a href="https://github.com/hubotio/hubot/graphs/contributors">unmaintained for years</a>, and it may <a href="#narrow/stream/127-integrations/topic/Hubot.20integration.20issues/near/1205324">not be possible to run it</a> anymore.</p>

<p>Of course this is how it always works- I ran it for the fourth time and it worked. I fiddled with npm a little in between. Both hubot and the zulip are starting to show their age and decay. Getting it set up was putsy because hubot has a lot of quirks, but it does still work for me. Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>Zulip is actively develop compared to Hubot.</p>
