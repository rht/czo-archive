<p>I was able to create a new account and stay signed in on that account once. I still have that tab open. However, when I try to sign into that account from private browsing windows and so on, it never recognizes the (correct) password. Additionally, now when I (or some testers) try to create a new account, we get an "internal server error." I'm not sure if these issues are related.</p>
<p>I'm running zulip inside of a Docker-Compose container on a Debian 11 homeserver. I've got TLS, certificates, port forwarding, and all that under control. It's running behind a reverse proxy Apache2 server on the same server hardware so that I can have Zulip running at a subdomain and something else running on the main domain, if that's relevant.</p>
<p>What might further be relevant is that this is a server I'm running for a small community of friends, so it's not like this is particularly pressing right now. However, if anyone has a clue as to what might be going on, that would be appreciated.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="26858">@alexis</span> if you've got an internal server error, you should find the actual error in the server logs.  <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/troubleshooting.html">https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/troubleshooting.html</a> should help, but you'll also want to look at your Apache error logs in case the reverse proxy is responsible.</p>
