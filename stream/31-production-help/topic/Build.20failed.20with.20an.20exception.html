<p>Sourab Banka9:33 PM<br>
Hello,<br>
I'm Sourab Banka from Don Bosco Institute of Technology, Mumbai, India.<br>
I'm familiar with React, React-Native, JavaScript, Python and Django, I have also developed some projects on React and React Native. I came across zulip from the archive page of Google Summer of Code. I have set up the development environment for zulip-mobile and I have gone through all the read the docs section.</p>
<p>But when I run the command react-native run-android i get the following error:</p>
<p>FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.</p>
<p>What went wrong:<br>
Could not open settings remapped class cache for 8xjj32r11t99w40bb4d7rc26g (C:\Users\soura\.gradle\caches\5.5.1\scripts-remapped\settings_3lm6crajgve51r2nw0gpkheyl\8xjj32r11t99w40bb4d7rc26g\settings607e3b0704a468e3ccebfac8f1ad43c0).<br>
Could not open settings generic class cache for settings file 'C:\Users\soura\OneDrive\Desktop\Open_Source\zulip-mobile\android\settings.gradle' (C:\Users\soura\.gradle\caches\5.5.1\scripts\8xjj32r11t99w40bb4d7rc26g\settings\settings607e3b0704a468e3ccebfac8f1ad43c0).<br>
BUG! exception in phase 'semantic analysis' in source unit '_BuildScript_' Unsupported class file major version 57</p>
<p>I already had this similar issue while working on another react-native project and I did resolve it by updating the particular lines of the file android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties<br>
from<br>
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-5.5-all.zip<br>
to<br>
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-6.0.1-all.zip</p>
<p>As far as I know this is a problem particularly concerned with jdk version as i am using jdk13<br>
Should i do this particular change and proceed ahead or should i downgrade my jdk version?</p>
<p>I'm aiming for GSoC 2020.<br>
Thanks.</p>
