<p>hi! just getting zulip up and running self hosted, everything seems to be in order, but I can't seem to figure out the sendgrid setup (mailgun is now paid aftyer 30days). I'm not sure what value to enter into settings.py <code>email_host_user</code>, is it the FROM address? in sendgrid, this has to be a real address (it requires verification and a code). Sendgrid also says not to use gmail addresses (which also failed anyway)</p>
<p>am i supposed to setup a separate postfix server at my domain? what value do i put in <code>email_host_user</code>?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="26762">@Ben</span> FWIW I think the Mailgun pricing is very close to 0 if you're sending a moderate amount of emails; a recent bill for Mailgun usage for <a href="http://chat.zulip.org">chat.zulip.org</a> is $5.35 for 20.7K outgoing emails, and I'm pretty sure their pricing is just linear in usage.</p>

<p>But for Sendgrid, does <a href="https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/django">https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/django</a> help? The main authentication settings for Zulip are just the Django ones.</p>

<p>wow i never would have found that, trying now - thanks! I will also take another look at mailgun, that's pretty reasonable , hopefully I misread the pricing</p>

<p>Thoughts on whether we should add a link to that Sendgrid page in our email docs?</p>

<p>that might be a good idea, but it's most helpful to understand that Zulip is actually using the Django auth settings, and that's why it works</p>
