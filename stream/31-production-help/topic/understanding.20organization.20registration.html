<p>Hey guys, I'm currently on the hunt for a self-hosted chat application for my company. We work with the government and for compliance reasons we need to self-host our data. We've been using rocket.chat and that's worked reasonably well, but there's a growing interest to switch to Zulip. I've been looking into hosting it internally and I have a few questions that I can't seem to get a clear answer on.</p>
<p>First, as the title suggests, what's the deal with registering my organization on your platform? We have an internal LDAP server that I was going to use for authentication and account management, and I don't understand the purpose of publicly registering the organization.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="16844">@Jesse Roland</span> what kind of registering are you referring to specifically? The only way that I can think of in which self-hosted servers register with us is for activating push notifications <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/mobile-push-notifications.html">https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/mobile-push-notifications.html</a> and that is not obligatory, as the doc also outlines what would need to be done to make your server capable of doing push notifications independently.</p>

<p>yeah I was reading the docs and it had registering the org as one of the steps and I was curious what it was used for. That makes sense. Thank you!</p>
