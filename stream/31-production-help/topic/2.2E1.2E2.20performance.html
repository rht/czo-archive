<p>Since upgrading to 2.1.2, my end users are essentially unanimous in the feeling that Zulip isn't as responsive as it use to be<br>
Particularly, users have noted an uptick in the frequency of:</p>
<ul>
<li>messages waiting to send (with the "Sending...." note)</li>
<li>waiting for messages to be edit-able </li>
<li>having messages re-order (e.g. A, B, C, D on client turns into D, A, B, C after a time)</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe all of these have a root in server performance (i.e. the server is slower to respond to clients)</p>
<p>I do not have any error messages in the error log and the host itself seems to be OK with CPU/RAM (though if there are concrete measurements to perform, I would appreciate that)</p>
<p>Any idea on how to identify the bottleneck?</p>

<p>Those are all symptoms of the Tornado server being overloaded; the first thing I'd look at is <code>grep Tornado /var/log/zulip/server.log</code> and look at what sort of percentages you're seeing there.</p>

<p>We have significant work in progress to improve the scalability of that in master since 2.1.2 (and more coming soon into master), so it's possible the near-term solution would be to upgrade that.  There's a few other ideas we can discuss as well.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="9893">@Mike Ray</span> yes, hitting 90% is problematic in that it never logs 100% (it just stop logging when overloaded, due to a design bug in the logging).</p>

<p>So great, we understand the cause.  My guess is you could fix it by upgrading to master, where we've done some performance work impacting Tornado.</p>

<p>And simpler workaround would be to modify <code>send_presence_changed</code> to immediately return; we have a few folks doing that to lower Tornado load.  The user-facing impact is that when a user comes online, they won't appear green in the right sidebar for an extra minute.</p>

<p>That's the only effect of <code>send_presence_changed</code>; it makes the presence UI update immediately for just-logged-in users; they'll get the update in any case in the every-minute poll of new presence data (presence has its own independent sync system, and we use Tornado for presence just for these instant updates).</p>

<p>Gotcha, so that may keep tornado less busy.<br>
I'll go over the options with my colleagues<br>

<p>Well there will likely be a 2.1.3 release soon, though with coronavirus affecting things like my childcare I'm not going to make timing promises, and it'll be just bugfixes.</p>
<p>And of course a 2.2 is coming; we were aiming for about a month from now but again with the coronavirus situation who knows.  We run off master on <a href="http://zulipchat.com" target="_blank" title="http://zulipchat.com">zulipchat.com</a> FWIW, so it's a viable option in production.</p>
