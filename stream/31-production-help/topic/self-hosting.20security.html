<p>Im asking because I know that there is laws in USA which forces sw companies to make backdoors in their products which allow company or third subject to access data in their product and there is no way around it if you in that jurisdiction...but maybe I just dont understand implication of those local laws...thats why I asking</p>

<p>I'll add that the fact that Zulip is open source would make it more difficult for us to conceal that sort of bad behavior in a Zulip server release than it would be for a proprietary or Open Core software vendor.  But in any case I'd rather shut down Zulip than start shipping backdoored releases.</p>
<p>BTW, I'm going to move this thread to a new topic, please start new conversations using a new topic.</p>
