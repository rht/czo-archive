<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="25638">@Kevin</span> howdy! We don't have a feature for Imprints specifically, but I think it'd be pretty reasonable to add one. Can you write some notes on what you'd like to see in a good implementation of such a feature? </p>
<p>We do have this setting, which I imagine could be used for a brief imprint:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>## Many countries and bulk mailers require certain types of email to display
## a physical mailing address to comply with anti-spam legislation.
## Non-commercial and non-public-facing installations are unlikely to need
## this setting.
## The address should have no newlines.
# PHYSICAL_ADDRESS = &quot;&quot;
</code></pre></div>
<p>I don't think it's displayed anywhere outside of emails, currently.</p>
