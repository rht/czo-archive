<p>At the moment I only see the option to change user preferences before they are joining, but not afterwards. I would like to configure for all users that they have full-width design, notifications for channels etc. </p>
<p>Is there any option to handle it? I see no option in manage.py. I guess only database is an option but I cannot find the credentials and I am also not able to see the tables when I am using psql with the postgres user.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="21518">@Mathias Rumbold</span> you can adjust the database using <code>manage.py shell</code> or <code>manage.py dbshell</code>. See <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/management-commands.html">https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/management-commands.html</a>.</p>

<p>We will likely extend the "new user defaults" UI feature at some point to allow forcing settings for all users; we haven't done so yet because (1) the feature is new in the first place and (2) it's not clear what the right semantics are -- I can imagine situations where it would be very annoying to users to have their settings changed by another user.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="7">@Tim Abbott</span> thanks for the info. There are just one or two things I would like to force to all like full-width, not just for new customers but for all. Since we imported all from <a href="http://rocket.chat">rocket.chat</a> it is a bit hard to configure it since the organization was imported.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="21518">@Mathias Rumbold</span> yeah, that makes sense to me.  Certainly for data-imported users, who haven't specified their preferences yet, there's no reason we wouldn't want to allow overriding it.  Let us know if you have any trouble changing this with the <code>manage.py shell</code>.  (One could also do it by changing a couple lines in the import tool, if you're planning to re-import).</p>
