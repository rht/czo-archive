<p>Hello,<br>
I am not sure if anyone of you have encountered an error that you couldn't started a zulip docker container.<br>
The error I got is <br>
 ImportError: cannot import name 'EXTERNAL_HOST' from 'zproject.prod_settings' (/home/zulip/deployments/2022-03-30-01-27-07/zproject/prod_settings.py)<br>
Zulip migration failed with exit code 1. Exiting. </p>
<p>When I went to the directory, I noticed that I didn't have the following directory at all "2022-03-30-01-27-07/zproject/prod_settings.py"<br>
Does anyone have any suggestion that I can bring back my zulip docker?</p>
<p>Thank you so much. :)</p>

<p>Hi Tim,<br>
Thank you so much for replying to me the message. I really appreciate. <br>
The reason my zulip container stopped running was after I modified one line on  docker-compose.yml file. <br>
We wanted to use local postfix to deliver message from Zulip streams. <br>
Therefore, I changed SETTING_EMAIL_HOST: "<a href="http://abc.gmail.com">abc.gmail.com</a>" to SETTING_EMAIL_HOST: "localhost". <br>
However, Zulip container never came back online after I made that change. <br>
I got the following message when I issued docker-compose ps command.<br>
docker-zulip_zulip_1       /sbin/entrypoint.sh app:run      Exit 1</p>
<p>Then, I tried to comment out some extra lines that I added to docker-compose.yml. </p>
<p>volumes:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>  - &quot;/opt/docker/zulip/zulip:/data:rw&quot;
    # - &quot;/opt/docker/zulip/zuliplogs:/var/log/nginx&quot;
    # - &quot;/opt/docker/zulip/zuliplogs2:/var/log/zulip&quot;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Those two lines (commented out) were there before I changed our SETTING_EMAIL_HOST. <br>
I never encountered any issues before until yesterday after I tried to change setting_email_host parameter. </p>
<p>Actually, when those two lines were on the configuration file, zulip did run for few minutes and then it crashed. <br>
I had to comment them out in order to make zulip to run. <br>
I don't know why this is the case, but commenting out those two lines is the solution for us to bring back zulip. </p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any explanations or any suggestions for us.<br>
Thank you so much again for all your help. <br>
John</p>

<p>Actually, it crashed again not long after I posted my message. </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>      Name                        Command                State     Ports

<p>docker-zulip_database_1    <a href="http://docker-entrypoint.sh">docker-entrypoint.sh</a> postgres    Exit 0<br>
docker-zulip_memcached_1   <a href="http://docker-entrypoint.sh">docker-entrypoint.sh</a> sh -e ...   Exit 0<br>

docker-zulip_zulip_1       /sbin/entrypoint.sh app:run      Exit 137</p>
<p>According to what I learned Exit 137 is memory issue, is there a way that I can restrict the max memory for both docker-zulip_rabbitmq_1 and docker-zulip_zulip_1?</p>
<p>Thank you so much,<br>

<p>Hi Tim,<br>
I thought that memory usages was the issue, but it turned out it is not. <br>
The container complaints about  following error. <br>
/sbin/entrypoint.sh app:run,  Exit 1</p>
<p>When I ran by using docker-compose up, I got the following error. <br>
Error accessing Zulip secrets; manage.py in production must be run as the zulip user.<br>
I found a post on this subject, but there was no solution about this issue. <br>

<p>Just in case, anyone encounters the same issue as I did a couple days ago. <br>
I was able to resolve the issue by changing zulip-secrets.conf file permission from 640 to 644. <br>
/opt/docker/zulip/zulip/zulip-secrets.conf</p>
<p>After the change, I was able to start zulip container.  :)</p>
