<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="26850">Dominik Weckmüller</span> <a href="https://geo.rocks/post/zulip-server-setup/#7-maintenance">said in their blog post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just be careful that you never execute the Zulip scripts as <code>root</code> but always as Zulip user or with <code>su zulip -c</code> in front of the command. I did it once which led to an awful bug where Zulip changed ownership on the system messing with the DB and other components. No fun, but something easily revertible with <code>chown -R zulip:zulip /home/</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you recall what command you ran that did this?  The recommendation of only running things as <code>root</code> if it's absolutely necessary is good advice, but we generally also try to prevent commands from messing things up if run as the wrong user.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="26850">@Dominik Weckmüller</span> just to make sure he sees the question, since quote-and-reply does a silent mention.</p>

<p>Thanks for mentioning me <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="7">@Tim Abbott</span>. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="12178">@Alex Vandiver</span>  Unfortunately I don't quite remember at what point exactly I messed it up, but it happened when running the normal installation commands only that at some point I forgot to become zulip user and executed any of the Zulip scripts as root (which changed the owner to root). I guess it must have been any of <code>/home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts</code>. </p>
<p>I suppose I was configuring SMTP and restarted the server as root with <code>/home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/restart-server</code> instead of <code>su zulip -c /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/restart-server </code>.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure it was a command like this, just not exactly which one. I think it's a quite dangerous trap more people could fall into. We eventually found the error in the logs. I'll have a look tomorrow at work and post it here.</p>

<p>If you can find which one, that'd be helpful -- it'd be great to save others from that potential danger.</p>
<p><code>restart-server</code> specifically does have a check for this, so it wasn't that one. <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

<p>Ah wait, I think I also set up push notifications for mobile that day... <br>
Anyway before playing to much of a guessing game I'll better dive in the logs again :D</p>

<p>I think I found the culprit. After I sent emails for resetting the passwords to all users via <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/management-commands.html#other-useful-manage-py-commands">management command</a>: </p>
<p><code>./manage.py send_password_reset_email</code></p>
<p>It started to have problems. Logs:</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="26850">@Dominik Weckmüller</span>: We also assert that isn't running as root, for the management commands:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Bash Session"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">root@alexmv-prod:/home/zulip/deployments/current# </span>./manage.py<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">help</span>
<span class="go">manage.py should not be run as root. Use `su zulip` to switch to the 'zulip'</span>
<span class="go">user before rerunning this, or use</span>
<span class="go">  su zulip -c '/home/zulip/deployments/2023-06-07-20-20-00/manage.py ...'</span>
<span class="go">to switch users and run this as a single command.</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Those errors you show are from rabbitmq, specifically, and aren't about filesystem permissions at all.  Thoat looks like <code>scripts/setup/configure-rabbitmq</code> got run (again?) and dropped the <code>zulip</code> rabbitmq user.</p>

<p>hmm... one other thing I noticed - which could be related to the error logs too - is that for some reason I always ran OOM (out of memory) on a 4GB RAM server with default config and only 9 users (out of which 2-3 we're trying to change their password contemporarily), to be exact <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud">the x86 CX21 from Hetzner</a>.<br>
After upgrading to 8GB the errors were not occuring any more.</p>
<p>Note that I did not have the same problems with Arm64 4GB RAM CAX11 (which is afaik one of the cheapest options to host a Zulip instance).</p>
<p>Tomorrow I'll have another look in the logs but I suppose if noone else had the same issues, I made some other mistake somewhere I simply don't remember.</p>

<p>Interesting that the ARM worked better than the x86 for the same RAM.</p>
<p>We've seen notes about increased memory consumption on 6.x and later, but we have not done a thorough investigation.  See also <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="3" href="/#narrow/stream/3-backend/topic/reducing.20minimal.20memory.20usage">#backend &gt; reducing minimal memory usage</a>.</p>
