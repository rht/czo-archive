<p>Hi Zulip Community!</p>
<p>Our zulip server has been running fine without needing admin or any maintence for the past 3 months. </p>
<p>However, it recently went down in a strange manner. A few issues all happened around the same time:</p>
<ol>
<li>We were late on our cloud provider payment so our server was shutdown for a short period</li>
<li>SSL certs for our zulip server <a href="http://team.stackmate.org">team.stackmate.org</a> expired</li>
</ol>
<p>After clearing our payment dues and reissuing our ssl certs, we have been unable to access our server and get an Ambiguous 500 Error. </p>
<p>I have opened this PR <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/23699#issuecomment-1344570643">https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/23699#issuecomment-1344570643</a> with the entire error message requesting help and was redirected to this server. </p>
<p>I have been inspecting the server today and unable to find the source of this issue. </p>
<p>A side issue that I noticed is that when setting up Outgoing SMTP I have to keep updating settings.py manually from inside the docker container every time I restart the container. All required variables are passed as ENV in docker-compose yet they require manual setup. </p>
<p>Currently I am able to access the login page at <a href="https://team.stackmate.org">https://team.stackmate.org</a>, however, we are unable to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Login to old accounts</li>
<li>Send password reset emails</li>
<li>Get registration emails for new users.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also note: we have changed the email being used for outgoing SMTP. Is this an issue or can this email keep being changed without some reconfig?</p>

<p>The SSL certificate expiration is likely unrelated; it looks like you're using Lets Encrypt, so presumably it expired because the regular renewal didn't happen because the host was down.  Having an expired certificate for a bit won't cause any lasting harm, so we can likely ignore that part of the incident.</p>

<p>It sounds like you're using <code>docker-compose</code>.  The failure mode of "Realm matching query does not exist" sounds like your PostgreSQL server re-initialized itself with a clean empty schema and no data -- or, at least, some part of the datbase is missing.</p>

<p>I don't think you've told us what version of Zulip this is, and if you did any upgrades as part of your recovery.</p>
<p>Note that <a href="https://github.com/zulip/docker-zulip/releases/tag/6.0-0"><code>6.0-0</code> changed two potentially-relevant things</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It defaults to using Docker managed volumes (were you usiung thoise before?)</li>
<li>It uses PostgreSQL 14, not PostgreSQL 10, which requires explicit steps to transfer the data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for the support <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="12178">@Alex Vandiver</span> !</p>
<p>I am using  <code>zulip/docker-zulip:5.6-0</code>. I did not run any upgrades. I am still very new to zulip so I didn't attempt doing anything out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>I am using mounted docker volumes:<br>
For postgres in docker-compose I have the following:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code> - &quot;/mnt/secure-storage/postgresql/data:/var/lib/postgresql/data:rw&quot;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Which is usually what I do for most of my applications.</p>
<p>I briefly inspected the postgres database. I noticed a lot of tables . Should I be inspecting anything in particular?</p>
<p>Our organisation has only been using zulip for a few months and so its not a deal breaker if we lose data this time around, however I would like to :</p>
<ol>
<li>debug this issue and get to the bottom of it</li>
<li>know what to do in the future to avoid any data loss. I suppose this would primarily be backups and how to recover old state.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="25451">@Vishal Menon</span> well backups are always good to have just in case, but we're not aware of any data loss issues with Zulip, and hope to keep it that way.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="25451">@Vishal Menon</span> you can check the contents of the <code>zerver_realm</code> table; if it contains less than 2 realms, then that's a useful signal. (Or the <code>zerver_message</code> table -- it should have a lot of messages).</p>

<p>I suspect that whatever went wrong here involves the fact that your hosting provider shut down the system.</p>

<p>And that specifically it may not have been a clean shutdown, so the PostgreSQL instance may have been in inconsistent state.</p>
