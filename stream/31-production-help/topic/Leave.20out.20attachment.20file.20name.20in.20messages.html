<ul>
<li>is it possible to server-side leave out the Image/upload file name that is posted before every file i upload? I would prefer for my community having no title. Is that possible to control in server settings or is that a general decision of zulip? <br>
Thank you very much!</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not aware of any way to do it currently, but I agree with the idea - I really dislike when apps preserve the name of uploaded files, it's kind of an easy to miss privacy concern</p>

<p>Hm, why do we store the name of a file, even if you rename it when you post?</p>
<p>Can administrators view that file name somehow, or just the user who uploaded it?</p>

<p>If you download the file, it's in most situations nice for the filename to have been preserved.</p>

<p>Like, if I upload <code>zulip-server-5.1.tar.gz</code>, and you download it, you'd probably prefer to download a file called <code>zulip-server-5.1.tar.gz</code>, not <code>abcd1234.tar.gz</code>, or some other random string we might generate that isn't the original filename.</p>
<p>And our Markdown system has you pick a label for a __link__ to the uploaded file, not the file itself; if I type <code>You can download the release [here](.../zulip-server-5.1.tar.gz)</code>, then nobody wants clicking that link to give you a file called <code>here</code>.</p>

<p>Users concerned about privacy can of course rename a file on their local system to something generic before uploading them.</p>

<p>I'd be curious whether other chat systems provide a way to choose the name of a file while uploading it; I feel like it's a bit of a UI challenge to do so without complicating/slowing the flow (like having a modal pop up asking you what you want to name the new file you're uploading). I could see having a privacy option to offer such a prompt.</p>

<p>Ah, I see, makes sense.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think something that's not ideal there is that it might not be obvious to users that others can see the file name, because there is also a named link, and that name is what is clearly visible in the message you send?</p>
