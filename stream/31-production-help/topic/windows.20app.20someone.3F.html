<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="26348">@Flávio Zarur Lucarelli</span> please just post in the original topic, rather than making new ones. And see <a href="https://zulip.com/help/link-to-a-message-or-conversation">https://zulip.com/help/link-to-a-message-or-conversation</a> for how to link.</p>
<p>You seem to have an issue with the spellchecker on Windows that nobody else has reported has can reproduce; I'm not sure we have a good way to debug that as the issue likely depends on some detail about your computer that is hard to guess. I don't think we have the resources to debug it with you individually, so I think the issue will remain a known bug until someone else can reproduce it (either another user reporting it or a developer figuring out how to).</p>

<p>If we have two users with the problem, we can at least try to cross-compare what is the same about their systems and use that to figure out things to test.</p>

<p>We don't have the resources to for free debug every weird issue that we can't reproduce and have only seen a single user report. If this issue is important to you, you can consider buying a support contract.</p>

<p>Hi, Tim, how are you? I have and I'm not getting responses.</p>
<p>But nobody tested in the windows app. ;)</p>
<p>I guess I'll open a bug report, is that Ok? All I'm asking is for someone to help me test in the windows app. Isn't that possible? </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>or at least nobody replies to me saying they can test it in the windows app. I believe I end up helping the product too, of course, that's also my goal, I have sent some good suggestions in your github, etc</p>
