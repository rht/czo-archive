<p>Hello, I have a specific authentication use-case that may not be covered by the current implementation.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want <code>SAMLAuthBackend</code> users to have their accounts created automatically when they first sign in. They should not need an invitation since they already have the SAML account, as that implies they are trusted.</li>
<li>I want these trusted users to be able to invite other users, and these invited users can register and log in via <code>EmailAuthBackend</code>.</li>
<li>I am undecided on if these email login users should be able to invite people of their own; if it's not possible to differentiate this I won't worry about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I expected that by forcing invitations to be necessary to join the org, SAML users would be able to sign in if <code>auto_signup</code> is enabled in the SAML configuration. However, they are denied and told they need an invitation. I could disable this setting, but that means anyone can register via email without an invitation, which is not what I want.</p>
<p>Is there some kind of combination of settings I can apply to achieve this? Or is this a bug with the implementation of <code>auto_signup</code>?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="12178">@Alex Vandiver</span>  I'm not super concerned about SAML users getting special permissions vs other users, I mostly just want a way for SAML users to bypass needing to be invited specifically. It sounded like <code>auto_signup</code> was something I would use to achieve that goal. If that's not possible though I might be able to shim something with LDAP sync, but I would rather not.</p>

<p>an example of why relying on LDAP sync would be bad is that the user will not exist until the next sync, so if someone creates an account in the IdP, then tries to open Zulip and log in via SAML (not LDAP), they will still be told they need an invite until the next sync creates their account.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="27216">@sev</span> Yeah, invitations requirement applies to all the backends currently (except possibly ldap, since it has some special code of its own for creating users). The intent of <code>auto_signup</code> is not to allow skipping the requirement, but to just skip the little "Confirm you want to create an account" page that one gets when they end up creating a new account while going through the "Login with SAML" button.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/16722">https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/16722</a> is the specific issue for what you're requesting though - to allow a specific backend to ignore the invitation requirement. I think I had some work in progress on it, but didnt end up making a PR yet.</p>

ok... hit a roadblock in the above scheme.</p>
<p>I planned to map <code>email</code> to <code>mail</code> and <code>delivery_email</code> to <code>%(uid)s@user.zulip.example</code>, so that correct user email can show up and can be freely changed via LDAP/IdP, while the actual Zulip username stays constant. I then configured mail server to redirect <code>user@user.zulip.example</code> to <code>user@real.mail.address</code>. However, based on my reading it does not seem possible to modify the returned LDAP attribute. So to get this working I will have to extend my LDAP schema and calculate the Zulip username at account creation :/</p>
<p>is there any other path I can take here? Please tell me I'm overthinking this and I don't have to do this nonsense just to get user sync to work.</p>

<p>I went ahead and did as I described and everything is working... but it seems I misunderstood the difference between <code>email</code> and <code>delivery_email</code>, in that <code>email</code> is fully deprecated aside from API use, and is never shown to the user.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="27216">@sev</span> Yeah the inability to track user accounts via some stable id in LDAP other than the email is a problem, that there isn't really a good way to work around right now - what you did sounds about the best that can be done. I don't think there's a good way of getting around the display issue to be honest... You can put the user's real email address in a custom profile field at least I suppose. Perhaps that's not an issue for you, but I'll also note the Zulip uses the <code>delivery_email</code> to send email notifications, so that'll of course be broken with this set up.</p>
<p>There's a pull request <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/16208">https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/16208</a> for getting a proper stable user id from ldap, that would fix the need for this whole scheme, but it hasn't been finished thus far. </p>
<p>We also have SCIM, which is a a nice protocol for user account sync specifically (<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/scim.html">https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/scim.html</a>), in case that's something you want to take a look at as well. But it's only been implemented and tested with Okta in mind  - I would expect that integrating it with another provider would require some tweaks to the code (we'd be happy to accept PRs for them though to improve the implementation)</p>

<p>My IdP supports SCIM. I notice the LDAP integration does not automatically create users (this is very very awesome), does SCIM do this?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="27216">@sev</span> Yes, SCIM automatically creates them - that's kind of its big point - it also automatically syncs (the syncable) changes to the users, like if you change the user's full name or email in the provider, it gets immediately synced to Zulip via the SCIM API. So no need to wait for the LDAP sync cronjob to run.</p>
<p>Can you say what is your provider? I can check if they have some nice docs that would let me figure out e.g. at least how far our implementation of SCIM is from compatibility with it and what changes may be needed</p>

<p>right now I have a static attribute on all my LDAP users that contains the Zulip username, and I use that as the email in the LDAP sync. authentik supports expression policies so if SCIM is used, I can remove that and only provide it via SCIM/SAML from one source, authentik.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="27216">@sev</span> Hmm, it seems to be a new feature (added in <code>2023.3</code> version) and doesn't seem to have docs aside of what you linked?

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="10349">@Mateusz Mandera</span> so I got the SCIM integration set up, but Zulip isn't accepting user changes. does Zulip need to receive Patch operations for this, or does it use <code>externalId</code> as an anchor?</p>
<p>In the first case, authentik will not send Patch ops as Zulip does not implement <code>ServiceProviderConfig</code> to tell authentik it supports them, and authentik defaults to <a href="https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/blob/24244d6ff462d282e279f04f20a1bc45a46f31f4/authentik/providers/scim/clients/schema.py#L41">not using it</a> with no way to configure otherwise. It also occasionally will ask Zulip for an updated config, so I am getting inundated with Django error emails about it.</p>
<p>In the second case, that's fantastic, as it means I no longer need to use this ugly shim in my email system so that users always have the same email in Zulip to avoid duplicate users when people change their email address. <code>externalId</code> is a hash of their username so it should never change as I do not allow username changes. How can I add the IDs to my Zulip users so it picks up the changes?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="27216">@sev</span> Zulip doesn't look at <code>externalid</code>, it's ignored. It supports PATCH updates, but doesn't require them. The issue I'm seeing here is something different though. An update request in SCIM can be  PATCH or PUT.  But your request is a <code>POST</code> and in SCIM that's a "create" operation. So I believe that authentik is trying to create this user and doesn't understand that the user is supposed to already exist on the server and just be updated. I don't know what are the options to make authentik behave correctly here, since I didn't find any more docs as mentioned - but the way that Okta does it by default is that it first checks via a GET SCIM request whether the user already exists to know if it should be creating (POST) or updating (PUT).</p>

<p>as I mentioned, and as far as I know, authentik will not send PATCH or PUT because Zulip does not tell it that it supports it via <code>ServiceProviderConfig</code>, and authentik does not expose any functionality to override this behavior.</p>

And the alternative to PATCH is PUT, which it should be using for update operations.</p>

<p>I guess I can open an issue, the dev is pretty responsive</p>

<p>My understanding is that it authentik in this case  just doesn't understand the user already exists (perhaps their implementation may not even support such a situation yet? I don't know) and is trying to create them. I'd suggest trying this on a new user profile, that doesn't yet exist in Zulip and seeing if that will be handled correctly by the integration at least</p>

<p>there were 3 users created by the first hourly sync from authentik, that didn't already exist. I can check the logs for them</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="10349">@Mateusz Mandera</span> yes, it seems for the users that already existed before the sync started, authentik is repeatedly trying to create them; the others are being modified with <code>PUT</code>. I imagine I can modify this in the authentik database to have them marked as existing, as contrarily there is no interface to do so. I will open an issue for this with authentik, since either that functionality should be exposed for the user to configure or it should look up to see if the user already exists.</p>

<p>Yup, that sounds like a good idea. If needed to make this work for your setup, I can also help out with a quick tweak to the Zulip code to make it just return a success on those POST requests if the user already exists - to trick authentik into thinking everything's fine now and proceed normally. E.g. in case you don't find any good way to tweak this on the authentik db side.</p>
