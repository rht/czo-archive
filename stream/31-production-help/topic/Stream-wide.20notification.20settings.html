<p>Hi,</p>
<p>every user can change their notification settings in the personal settings menu.</p>
<p>Is it possible that a stream can overwrite this settings, for example that every user gets an email and a push notification for this stream no matter what the user has set for this stream (so it is a realm or admin setting)?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="14849">@Ronny</span> we are close to adding a set of features that would make setting the defaults of those settings something one can do for the organization as a whole, so we are working on that direction.</p>

<p>I may add a note from the university point of view: it might become handy to be able to overwrite the personal notification settings per stream in order to ensure that the students at least <strong>receive</strong> the contents of an announcement stream (and than hopefully read them <span aria-label="grinning face with smiling eyes" class="emoji emoji-1f601" role="img" title="grinning face with smiling eyes">:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:</span>)</p>

<p>I can fully agree with Robert! </p>
<p>Some streams by us have only a few messages but they are very important like: <br>
"hey ... please provide us ... <strong>until</strong> ..." or<br>
"I have this/that problem, what should I do ...." </p>
<p>The goal of this setting is, that no one can say: "oh i didn't get an email message or i didn't get an notification in the mobile app...." (and yes, if those messages are read by the person, it is another problem <span aria-label="wink" class="emoji emoji-1f609" role="img" title="wink">:wink:</span>)</p>
<p>The settings should "overwrite" the user settings for this stream(s) including this setting "Send mobile notifications even if I'm online (useful for testing) ", so that an user gets always notified.</p>

<p>Hi Alya, thanks for the suggestions! :)<br>
I think option 3 could be the most useful one because you can</p>
<ul>
<li>enforce specific notifications (e.g. email notifications),</li>
<li>but a user is still able to add additional notifications (e.g. desktop or mobile notifications) if they like.</li>
</ul>

<p>I see how this could be useful.  One concern I have with a "subscribers always get emails for messages in this stream" feature is that there's a spam issue it could create.  We don't want to put users in a situation where they don't have a clear path to unsubscribe from any category of notification emails.  </p>
<p>One possible solution to that is that we'd change the "How to unsubscribe" text at the bottom of the email if such a configuration were enabled to be something like "This stream is configured to send email notifications to all subscribers.  You can unsubscribe from the stream or deactivate your account to stop receiving these notifications.", with several of those being links.</p>

<p>Well, in my context, the course instructors do not want the students to unsubscribe from the notifications, anyway <span aria-label="joy" class="emoji emoji-1f602" role="img" title="joy">:joy:</span> <br>
But of course, I understand your point and I think that your suggested solution is very reasonable.</p>

<p>Yeah, I understand that for the "all users are students in a course" context, that totally makes sense, but I can imagine various open communities where it would be poor for an administrator to be able to force email notifications for everyone subscribed to a given stream.</p>

<p>(And so we should at least advertise that an end user can deal with this situation themselves by unsubscribing)</p>

<p>Hi, I agree with Robert. </p>
<p>But an user shouldn't be able to unsubscribe from a stream by himself, because of:</p>
<ol>
<li>it is like a "disable notification" setting</li>
<li>if a stream is used for notification of users, than an admin have to check each time before sending a message that really all users are subscribed.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="7">@Tim Abbott</span> <br>
I can follow you because of your spam message concerns, but students or employees should "follow" the given rules of the organization.</p>
<p>In both cases, no one should be able to enter or leave the stream (only allowed by the admin). At the end all users always have the possibilities to filter those email messages or to disable the push notifications (at os level).</p>

<p>It seems like there may be a second feature here, then -- a stream setting for whether or not it's possible to unsubscribe. This could be independent from the notification setting. If a stream has mandatory subscription and notifications, then the notification email would just tell users that they can stop getting notifications by deactivating their account.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="19257">@Alya Abbott</span> do you want to write the issue for this?  I guess one question is whether we want this to fit within the "user groups for permissions settings" framework, as a "Who can unsubscribe from this stream" setting (and you'd set that to "nobody" to implement this policy)?</p>
