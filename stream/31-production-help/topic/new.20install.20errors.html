<p>Hi, </p>
<p>I'm installing zulip on ubuntu, I get the following errors: </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>N: Ignoring file &#39;zulip.list.apt-update-in-progress&#39; in directory &#39;/etc/apt/sources.list.d/&#39; as it has an invalid filename extension
</code></pre></div>
<p>This error has dissappeared in the latest two tries, but has been buffeling me before.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>++ su postgres -c &#39;psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -Atc &#39;\&#39;&#39;SELECT COUNT(*) FROM zulip.zerver_message;&#39;\&#39;&#39; zulip&#39;
ERROR:  relation &quot;zulip.zerver_message&quot; does not exist
LINE 1: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM zulip.zerver_message;
</code></pre></div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>File &quot;/srv/zulip-venv-cache/a....8/zulip-py3-venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/bmemcached/protocol.py&quot;, line 322, in _send_authentication

bmemcached.exceptions.MemcachedException: (&quot;Code: 32 Message: b&#39;Auth failure.&#39;&quot;, 32)
</code></pre></div>
<p>How can it be that things don't exist when the script should be creating them? Are the errors at all connected?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="23050">@tornuggla</span> it seems like several things have gone wrong in your installation; can you talk about the host system you're installing Zulip on?</p>

<p>Uploading the <code>/var/log/zulip/install.log</code> script would be helpful.</p>

<p>Those errors generally look like what might happen if the installer didn't finish; most likely you should rerun the installer and get it to complete cleanly.</p>

<p>ED: Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS <br>
5.4.0-96-generic <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/109">#109</a>-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jan 12 16:49:16 UTC 2022 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux</p>
<p>not a disposable vm, it's a vps. I tried installing several times. First time around I had errors with nginx, so I deleted my old configfile and reran the installation of zulip. The nginx error dissapeard but instead the database 'zulip' was not found. I reran, without doing anything, now the database seems to exist but not the mentioned relation. i reran several times since then with no further change, even removing postgresql from the vps for a fresh start on that. </p>
<p>install.log appended</p>
<p>thanks for any input! <a href="/user_uploads/2/59/vSP3YZIqG_bXR1p3t8F7d9TH/install.txt">install.txt</a></p>
<p>(sorry for keeping you waiting, I had trouble getting scp to work and had to copy from the terminal, so you only get the latest attempts log...)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="23050">@tornuggla</span> it sounds like the core problem here is that you had a bunch of other software previously installed on the system, including perhaps some that left <code>apt</code> in a weird, whose own configuration choices conflicted with Zulip's.  I suggest using a fresh system.</p>

<p>We don't support this sort of multi-application configuration precisely because doing so requires debugging/understanding all the other services one might be running on the system.  You can install zulip in a container on your VPS if you like.</p>

<p>yea, sounds reasonable, I actually had no clue in what state i left that vps, hadn't used it for a while, but yes, I had nextcloud on it before. Still I thought the error with the non-existent relation was kinda peculiar. </p>
<p>I'll try with a fresh system. Thanks anyway :)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="23050">@tornuggla</span> I think the non-existent relation thing isn't an error, it's just output from checking whether the system might already have content in its database as a safety precaution before dropping the database and making a new one.</p>

<p>(Which is part of making the installer idempotent)</p>

<p>Hi all, I just wanted to share my experience with a (now) successful installation. I kept getting 404 errors, or just total time-out, when clicking on the link to set up a new organisation. Nothing in the error logs, I tried multiple times to reinstall. The solution, as it turned out, was very straightforward.</p>
<p>Even though my Hetzner server was above the minimum spec, I couldn't access the Zulip instance until I upgraded it; maybe it's worth looking again at the minimum requirements guidance?</p>
<p>Thanks for giving me the opportunity to work with this amazing platform btw :)</p>

<p>It was the basic one; CX11 so 1vCPU, 2GB ram, 20GB disk space. I needed to up it (chose CX21) to make it install, but then I have since downgraded back to CX11 for operation and it seems to be fine. <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud">https://www.hetzner.com/cloud</a></p>
