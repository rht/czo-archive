<p>Dear, Sirs, today we had this issue when try sending messages and messages not delivered.:</p>
<p>=WARNING REPORT==== 28-Jun-2021::20:41:59 ===<br>
closing AMQP connection &lt;0.643.0&gt; (127.0.0.1:54978 -&gt; 127.0.0.1:5672, vhost: '/', user: 'zulip'):<br>
client unexpectedly closed TCP connection</p>
<p>Maybe someone has already faced a similar problem and has a solution? <br>
Updating to the latest release did not affect the situation, as did reinstalling RabbitMQ.<br>
Thank you.</p>
