<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm trying to configure outgoing email, but I need the sender address to match the EMAIL_HOST_USER in order for it to be accepted by the mail server. I thought I could use the NOREPLY_EMAIL_ADDRESS to set that, but it seems like Zulip is using a randomly generated reply address, for example: 'noreply-7voxcq9t7truud3j8mm4kxz4@EXTERNAL_HOST'. when it sends. Is there a way to get it to use the NOREPLY_EMAIL_ADDRESS for sending the mail?</p>
<p>It seems like the from address is used in django/core/mail/backends/smtp.py line 127:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>    def _send(self, email_message):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;A helper method that does the actual sending.&quot;&quot;&quot;
        if not email_message.recipients():
            return False
        encoding = email_message.encoding or settings.DEFAULT_CHARSET
        from_email = sanitize_address(email_message.from_email, encoding)
        recipients = [sanitize_address(addr, encoding) for addr in email_message.recipients()]
        message = email_message.message()
        try:
            self.connection.sendmail(from_email, recipients, message.as_bytes(linesep=&#39;\r\n&#39;))
</pre></div>


<p>I don't know where email_message.from_email comes from, but it seems to be randomly generated.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="9719">@micah</span> There is a setting to disable the randomized reply addresses, though you'll want to read the accompanying discussion about why that feature is there:<br>
