<p>I have a couple self-hosted instances of Zulip 6.0 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.   There have been some errors I see Spit out over the time it has been up. A few months now. Usually, Timeout types of mistakes.  I was thinking of updating to the newer 6.02 version.  I noticed that Version 7 is due out not that long away.  </p>
<p>My questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Should  I upgrade to the point releases of Zulip before going to Version 7 when available?</li>
<li>What is best practices for Zulip in trying to keep it up to date.   Should I always do the point releases, or can I do the major releases unless there is some MAJOR issue?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you for all you do. I am new to the product, but so far, it has been an excellent experience compared to other open-source projects I have worked with.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="26639">@Jerry Broughton</span> We generally recommend always upgrading to the point releases; they're designed to be very low risk upgrades and often fix important security or reliability issues.</p>

<p>You generally don't need to do intermediate upgrades; though see <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade.html#upgrading-the-operating-system">https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade.html#upgrading-the-operating-system</a> for some cases where that's necessary if you're quite far behind.</p>

<p>You should post the specific errors you're seeing; it is our goal that there not be random exceptions in production instances.</p>
<p><a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/troubleshooting.html">https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/troubleshooting.html</a> has some advice on how to post logs (E.g. use a code block).</p>
