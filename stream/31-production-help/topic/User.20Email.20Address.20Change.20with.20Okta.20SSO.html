<p>We are running Zulip Server version 6. The only Authentication method we have enabled is with Okta SSO. One of my users primary email address has changed and the next time they tried to signin to Zulip it saying that his account has been deactivated. <br>
We have tried to change the Zulip email address in Okta, but that didnt fix it. </p>
<p>While it would be nice to keep this users past message history, the more important thing would be to get them back on the system. Any Ideas on how to fix this?</p>

<p>We are not opposed to binging the accounts local and not using Okta SSO if needed. It is a small team and we can make it work if that is possible.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="25811">@Jeremiah</span> you can use the <code>change_user_email</code> managemnet command documented here to align the user's email address in Zulip with that in Okta: <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/management-commands.html">https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/management-commands.html</a></p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="7">@Tim Abbott</span> That worked. Thank you very much. For some reason the new email address was in the database already and I<br>
 was able to change it, and then change this users email. The user was able to login fine.</p>
