<p>We can make the image less high, but I see two experiences people would want: (1) some amount of preview, with an image that's big enough to see what's in it (2) no preview at all, which can be set in the settings</p>

<p>Slack's image preview is much larger, for example -- and I think we can do better than that while still having the image stacked above.</p>

<p>The current setting is an organization-level setting, without any good way to control the choice for individual links.</p>
<p>At times I wonder whether the right model is to support like 3-4 different styles of previews, and have some way to have the sender pick which one you're going to do, but I don't see a good way to do UI for that choice.</p>

<p>There's definitely an issue with a design along those lines; not going to look it up like now since I'm trying to churn through 1.1k unreads today.</p>
<p>I consider the current feature basically beta quality until we add a way to control previews on an individual message basis, so it's potentially OK to make a change that is not perfect here... but I'd ideally like whatever changes we make to be working towards a conclusion we would be happy to turn on more broadly.</p>

<p>So I think the main thought I have on an individual user setting is maybe we want something that feels more like the "Enter sends" setting -- maybe you can access it in the settings panel, but you can change it from the compose box (maybe via the 3-dots menu).</p>

<p>There's also the question of how it would interact with the org-level setting; I think for now, the simplest story would be that you're only allowed to do it at all if the org-level setting is enabled (since there are good reasons an organization might not want this beta-quality feature being used in their org). And maybe later we expand the org-level setting to support a "disallow", "disabled by default", and "enabled by default" set of choices.</p>

<p>I think there are two things here.  I usually just want to suppress previews on the receiving end.  They don't bug me too much, but I would probably choose the setting if it were available.  I think Tim's talking more about the outbound side, which is also a legitimate thing to consider.</p>

<p>I think giving every user the option on the receiving end makes a lot of sense to me, since it doesn't make a huge difference functionally and is likely something people receiving would care most about. I do see how people sending messages might want to include or not include it though, and I think most apps have settings more of that type.</p>

<p>Ok, so link previews are useful when people publish just a link without any wording or there is a very show intro and the link.<br>
If there are multiple links or a link is in the middle of the text previews are breaking the flow.</p>
<p>Facebook made that super popular because people were posting links in their feed and that looked boring. So in addition to used by Google Title and Description we have images. </p>
<p>The way zulip does link previews right now isn't optimal but just the only way it can do. But I'm not sure that on average links with previews are much better than without them.</p>
<h3>How I see an ideal case?</h3>
<p>A person pasting a link into an editor and the editor don't paste the preview but can enable a button to paste the preview, simplifying user input of such. I'm not against pulling favicons at the beginning of links, because they are just like emoji.</p>
<p>And if we think that link preview is such a helpful thing to see before user actually clicks it we could provide preview on hover in a popover.</p>
<p>With such approach there is no need in any setting, if a preview is there - user pasted it like any other image or quote.<br>
Sure we can provide such setting for radicalists <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span> </p>
<p>But right now zulip doesn't have such an editor and there is an average "preview".  Would it be bad if we drop description and the image from the preview and just showing smaller image / favicon (there are many different sizes so it could be 64x64)? <br>
I don't think so. We don't have it in google and it looks just fine.</p>
<p><strong>About cutting the description</strong>. It is somewhat good thing because even Google suggest to have it  max 160 characters total.</p>
<p>So if let's don't change previews from the current state unless we are improving the editor experience as a whole.<br>
Let's keeping descriptions cut and we can do that with the same approach as we do with More/Less by masking that block.</p>
<p>In general I do think that current link previews are taking too much space and I would reduce them to big favicon + title.</p>

<p>Yeah I think I want to do something fairly holistic and focused on this detail if we want it to be nice, and it might make sense to just come back to this when we have the attention to do the N things that are required to get towards a globally good design vs. fiddling around near where we happen to be right now with the implementation.</p>

<p>Coming back to this...</p>
<p>The concept we currently have in GitHub for the <em>sender</em> side is to allow the sender to remove previews in the "preview" mode for a message and in the message feed. (<a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19465">#19465</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19466">#19466</a>). This would be useful for links where the sender knows that the preview is not helpful.</p>
<p>The issues don't address the specifics of educating users about the feature -- should we use a compose banner to make the message preview version of this discoverable? How do we make it clear that you are removing the preview for everyone, not just for yourself, in the message feed?</p>

<p>We don't have a design that combines the option to delete the preview for everyone + the option to hide it for yourself. To the extent we have this written up, both are represented as <code>x</code> on the left. I guess the sender option could be put in the message three-dot menu, but it would be hard to discover there.</p>

<p>I guess <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="22433">Vlad Korobov</span>  mentioned a couple of ideas that are on the recipient side:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show previews on hover rather than in the message feed directly.</li>
<li>Add a "show more" / "show less" button for expanding previews.</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess only one of those concepts at a time makes sense, unless on-hover vs. not is controlled by a setting.</p>

<p>I’m a bit confused. </p>
<p>If there is a user view setting to never show previews it should be respected but if we don’t have this setting lets not create it.</p>
<p>We can always show little link previews on hover for everybody (unless the preview is attached) - this is a separate feature</p>
<p>As a sender it would be nice to control how o have or not the preview. And there might be a user setting to always do that by default or now and this could be behind 3 dots. Its almost like do you want ctrl+enter to send or just Enter.</p>
<p>Per link preview removal make sense once we have not a mark down editor. Until then all or none setting “render link previews” behind the 3dots is fine</p>
