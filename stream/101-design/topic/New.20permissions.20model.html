<p>Many of you know that we've been wanting to make Zulip's permissions model more flexible, both for stream-level permissions and global permissions. I've now <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/19525">opened a master issue</a> for our plan for this, which essentially replaces every organization setting where you currently get to select a role with letting you select a user group instead.  (And <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19526">#19526</a> covers the work to make user groups management much better UI wise; we'll also be adding many new settings for administration of user groups as part of this project).  For a transitional period (and maybe forever), the current roles like Moderator will be available as "system groups" that can't be renamed in this design, so that we can migrate the infrastructure incrementally without temporary regressions.</p>
<p>For folks familiar with Discord, this at least as flexible as their "Roles" system (i.e. when done, every permission will be able to be given to an arbitrary user group, and user groups can nest within other user groups).  </p>
<p>This will be a multi-month project; as a result, I don't know whether it will make it in for Zulip 5.0 (tentatively scheduled for October); if it doesn't, I expect we'll choose the Zulip 6.0 release schedule primarily based on what is required to complete this migration in a way we feel great about.  (As a reminder, I'm <a href="#narrow/stream/65-checkins/topic/tabbott">on vacation</a> for the next 3 weeks).  That said, this project is one of the things I will be giving priority to in the limited work I will be doing while travelling.</p>

<p>Most of the permissions here are eg:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Group that can join this group themselves (default: nobody)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sole plural example seems to be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Groups that can mention this group (Specific roles shouldn't be able to mention specific user groups <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19029">#19029</a>) (default: everyone)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is the intent indeed that most of these will be "pick exactly one group" (and presumably if you want two, you can create a new group that contains those two groups)?</p>

<p>It can be useful to mention system groups (especially admins and moderators), so we should probably make them mentionable. If so, we should make it possible to control who can mention those groups in the group management UI, same as for other groups.</p>

<p>During development, we are not planning to make the automatically generated role-based groups mentionable, since it would likely result in a way to circumvent restrictions on who can use wildcard mentions in large streams.  The medium-term plan is to just have "who can mention this group" be a setting for the group.</p>

<p>Hi :)<br>

<p>Do we want to include bots in the role-based system groups? (All bots have role set as member by default). I think we should not include them.</p>

<p>The role-based system group for the "member" role will be used to express things like that a stream is public. A public stream will correspond basically to the "who can join" permission being set to the "member" role-based group.</p>
<p>Bots should generally be able to join public streams. So that means bots should be in the role-based group, just like other users/accounts.</p>

<p>Somewhat relatedly, do we want something for individual users to give access? (eg, in several communities I'm in, it would be common for me to have an "#adehnert" stream where I talk about whatever I want, and the permissions I'd want would presumably be me as the only owner, only person who can subscribe people, etc..I'd bet in many companies, a team lead will just want to specify themselves as the owner of their team's stream.) I guess maybe the answer may end up being "these settings implementation-wise allow exactly one group, but the UI will transparently create a group if you try to use a user and/or multiple groups".</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="591">@Alex Dehnert</span> yeah, we've not settled on the full UI/UX details, but that sort of model of an implicitly created "Owners of #adehnert" group is what we have in mind.</p>

<p>So one detail that is explained in the <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/19525">main issue</a> is that as part of transitioning existing permissions settings which allow selecting a given role to this groups model, we'll be creating "system groups" that represent e.g. "All users with the moderator role" and are maintained implicitly when editing users' role in the UI.  It's unclear to me whether we will keep these transitional groups forever, but in any case, it's very possible they'll be an important part of the permissions experience for a year or more, so we should think about how they work.</p>
<p>The question at hand is what we want the description for these groups to be.  I think we currently plan for their name to be e.g. "Moderators" (though I don't think capitalization is settled) for the users with that role.  The first question is what folks think about that label.  The second question is what we want the group description to be -- e.g. should it be <code>System group containing all with the "Moderator" role.</code>?</p>
<p>This is the main decision remaining before merging <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19654">#19654</a>, which creates and maintains these groups (they won't be displayed in the UI in that first version; so only API clients can discover them).</p>

<p>Oh, one other naming detail: The group that contains everyone including guests should probably be called "Everyone", not "Guests", since while it's probably easy to understand that you're included in the "Moderators" group in you're an administrator, it's not at all obvious that being a Moderator/Member/etc. makes you implicitly a member of a "Guests" group.</p>

<p>Yeah; we have the option to go with names that are "Moderators" with a description that explains it's the "or above" concept, and a "Moderator role only" or something group for the exact role if we want those.</p>

<p>At present, it will not be possible to mention them, but we could change that in the future.  In any case, they will certainly be available when choosing who should have permission to do X, and I think in almost all cases one will want one of the "or above" role groups.</p>

<p>Yeah, if we think about these groups as effectively "The group of users who have the Moderator permission", then using the role names with s/Guest/Everyone/ makes a lot of sense.

<p>One other note about naming; do we want "Spectators" (i.e. logged-out users) to be representable in this permissions system?  If so, "Everyone" may not be the best name, since it would perhaps suggest that "Spectators" are included.</p>

<p>Well, one theory is that we just don't support giving spectators access to real email addresses, but I'm sure there will be settings where this is relevant.  (If nothing else, "who can view messages on this stream" would need to have effectively "Everyone on the Internet even without an account" as the displayed option when you've made your stream web-public, I think).</p>

<p>I agree with this. I think it would be good to have a future where the Moderators group can be renamed, and where there doesn't even need to be a group that really corresponds to Moderators -- an org might have one group that has a subset of "moderator" permissions, and another that has a superset but less than "admin". Or one group with a moderator-like set of permissions just for one set of streams, and another for another set of streams. Or something else.</p>
<p>In that future, there might still be a Moderators group whenever you create a new org, but it'd be like the streams <a class="stream" data-stream-id="1" href="/#narrow/stream/1-announce">#announce</a> or <a class="stream" data-stream-id="2" href="/#narrow/stream/2-general">#general</a> -- it's just an example and a starting point.</p>

<p>One thing we'd have to deal with in that future is what to do when introducing a new permission, where today we'd say that permission is given by default to "moderators" or to "admins" etc.</p>

<p>I guess one solution would be to pick some existing permission and say that the new permission gets granted to the same set of groups that have that one.</p>
<p>If in doubt what permission to pick, it's always safe to pick one that already implies the same powers; if nothing else, there's always "owners", or whoever has the ability to grant the permission to other users.</p>
<p>The main downside of that conservative option is that sometimes the point of a new permission is to give a wider set of users a limited version of some power that a smaller set already had. In that case, in a new org we might be giving the permission to all moderators, but the conservative option would mean that an existing org which hadn't touched their permission settings would have the permission go only to admins or owners. That divergence feels like it'd be a source of confusion -- the docs would be either complicated or inaccurate -- and also would mean the feature effectively didn't make it out to most users in existing orgs.</p>
<p>So hmm, that doesn't seem good. The more general template of "pick some existing permission to clone from" works, but we'd want to pick one that goes to the same default group as we want the new permission to go to, so that the bulk of existing orgs (which haven't extensively customized their permissions) will continue to stay in sync with the defaults apart from where they've chosen otherwise.</p>

<p>I think Anders might be right that in most cases we could clone from the users who have a related permission and get a reasonable default.  We could do a bit of a study on specific cases to see if that checks out for the last 10 permissions we've wanted to add.</p>

<p>What I'm really thinking about with that list is a UI like where you're choosing who can read the messages in a stream. I think a good UI for that would involve a dropdown where "Everyone on the Internet" is a string that's part of the UI -- it's not a user-edited string.</p>

<p>I think "Everyone on the Internet" is a good approach to the wording for the web-public option.</p>
<p>The term "Account holders" feels jargony to me. I think something like "Everyone in the Zulip organization", or "Everyone in <code>**${realm.name}**</code>", would be clearer. Possibly with "including guests" if we want to be explicit about that.</p>
<p>So for example a set of options could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>[… all the more-specific groups …]</li>
<li>Members of <code>**${realm.name}**</code> (not guests)</li>
<li>Everyone in <code>**${realm.name}**</code>, including guests</li>
<li>Everyone on the Internet</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I think those labels feel pretty good as group descriptions to me.  I think we would probably still want shorter group names for those; maybe something like  <code>@members</code> / <code>@everyone</code> /  <code>@internet</code>, given those descriptions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do we want to do next here? I think these names and descriptions are fine, do we want to proceed with these?</p>
<p>Also, I wanted to confirm how we would handle the spectator case. I don't think we would have a separate user-group in database for those since there will be no user-profile objects for them. We would just need to handle them specifically in code for permissions. I am not completely familiar with the code for spectators acccess but this is as per my current understanding.</p>

<p>Yeah, sorry I let this conversation get lost without a clear answer.  Here's a concrete proposal that I think answers all the questions needed to start merging data model commits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Owners: <code>@role:owners</code>.  Description: "Owners of this organization"</li>
<li>Administrators: <code>@role:administrators</code>.  Description: "Administrators of this organization, including owners"</li>
<li>Moderators: <code>@role:moderators</code>.  Description: "Moderators of this organization, including administrators"</li>
<li>Full Members: <code>@role:fullmembers</code>.  Description: "Members of this organization, not including new accounts and guests"</li>
<li>Members: <code>@role:members</code>. Description: "Members of this organization, not including guests"</li>
<li>Everyone: <code>@role:everyone</code>. Description: "Everyone in this organization, including guests"</li>
<li>Everyone on the Internet: <code>@role:internet</code>.  Description: "Everyone on the Internet".  This group would be implemented as a group that contains <code>@role:everyone</code>, and is also used for controlling spectators/web public streams behavior, for organizations that have that enabled.  I don't expect us to use this group in the immediate term, so it'll effectively be just a group containing <code>@role:everyone</code> that we create in the database migrations for the above.  Medium term, checks for whether a spectator can do something would be of the form "Does the group with permission to do X contain the @role:internet group?".  But I don't expect there'll be a need to do anything with this group until after we've migrated all the permissions dropdowns to work with groups rather than roles, so we're just optimistically trying to avoid extra data migration complexity for creating this at a different time from the rest.</li>
<li>If we ever feel the need to allow giving a permission to everyone on the Internet but not to some users with accounts, we can create an always-empty group of the name <code>@role:spectators</code> that <code>@role:internet</code> contains and is the thing that represents that special power, but I don't see a reason we'd need such a feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can potentially in UI elements replace "this organization" with <code>**{realm.name}**</code> as a nice touch if that feels nice when we're building UI components; but the above would be what appears in the database and the API (and thus any clients that don't implement such nice touches) to represent these role groups.</p>

<p>We can of course always rename these groups in the future if we decide the <code>role:</code> prefix is harmful (And force-rename any groups like <code>moderators</code> that might already exist, if necessary), but this seems like a safe set of choices that might work out in the long term, but in any case will at least let us build all the API and other infrastructure for migrating our systems to use groups to determine permissions without requiring as a prerequisite any coupled user-facing UI changes, beyond tiny things to not display / let you mention these system user groups (at least until we have a different way way to prevent these from being used to do wildcard mentions when you don't have permission to do them).</p>

<p>Stumbled across this as I was confused by the ingranularity of settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can't remove email address access from guests (which is important in a business where customers are onboarded in Zulip)</li>
<li>I can't restrict management of bots and user groups to moderators</li>
</ul>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>I was thinking of a kind of grid of permissions and roles.<br>
Since the current roles are incremental, something like a horizontal slider would probably be more appropriate there though.<br>
Not sure this makes sense anymore though when permissions can be given to each user group.</p>

<p>We've completed the first two major phases of implementing this with the merge of <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/21611">#21611</a>. We still have a long way to go: The project will probably end up requiring something like 8 major merges at this scale. Here's some notes on what we'll likely be doing next.</p>
<ul>
<li>I've updated <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/19525">https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/19525</a> with the things we've now merged (in concept -- didn't edit a few details that are off).</li>
<li>I suspect one of the good next projects will be extending <code>static/js/user_groups.ts</code> (and more broadly, the real-time sync codebase): "Do JS frontend work to be able to provide functions like is_user_in_group, which would walk the data structures and be able to determine at least whether the current user is in a given group. If needed these functions can call the API when called with another user group, but it's essential for rendering UI to know if the current user can do things without a server round trip." from <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19525">#19525</a>.</li>
<li>Another other thing we can do in parallel is start working on the UI widget for selecting a user group for a setting. It might be good for us to have a specific setting we're testing. (Originally, I was thinking the ideal setting would be a new permissions setting that we want to add an have be coupled to user groups -- since then we don't have to deal with the database complexity of migrating). But we can avoid that by just having the UI only list <code>is_system_group</code> user groups as options, and map it to the corresponding role before sending to the server, so no API changes required.  In any case, @alya let's pick something out.</li>
<li>While we plan to rewrite the "User groups" management UI (<a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19526">#19526</a>), it's possible we should look at how much work it'd be to display existing subgroups and be able to add a new subgroup. (It's likely at least some of the pills logic would be useful following a rewrite). I expect the initial UI work will primarily use the system groups that correspond exactly to roles, so this isn't a blocker for the above.</li>
<li>I started <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="3" href="/#narrow/stream/3-backend/topic/Groups.20and.20LDAP">#backend &gt; Groups and LDAP</a> for LDAP synchronization of groups, which will be much more useful once we do the rest of this.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hm, it would be nice not to have an intermediate state where one setting under Organization permissions randomly looks different from everything else. That might argue for a new setting, e.g. a stream-related one that wouldn't be in the org permissions panel? I'm not sure if there's a good relatively straightforward option.</p>

<p>I guess if we actually had checkboxes in the dropdown, it would probably get tricky with handling subgroups. E.g. if you check "Moderators", how does the "Admins" checkbox work?</p>

<li>Maybe you can't uncheck it because "Moderators who are not admins" is not a group?</li>

<p>It may be simpler to have a search/dropdown with pills for the selection, though we'd probably still want to communicate something about the nesting properties. It should somehow be clear to the user that once you've selected "Moderators", you don't need to <em>also</em> select "Admins".</p>

<p>Hm, so <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="7">Tim Abbott</span>  reminded me that back to when we discussed this a while back, we were thinking that we could potentially put all the complexity of managing multiple groups that have some permission into the group creation UI. That is, you'd only ever have one group have that permission, but there would be a "New group" option in the dropdown, which would let you create a group if you don't see one that fits what you want.</p>

<p>(Although if there are some other things to be taken care of before jumping into <code>"User groups" management UI</code>  and I might be missing please mention them and I would be happy to pick them up.)</p>

<p>Hm, so <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="7">Tim Abbott</span>  reminded me that back to when we discussed this a while back, we were thinking that we could potentially put all the complexity of managing multiple groups that have some permission into the group creation UI. That is, you'd only ever have one group have that permission, but there would be a "New group" option in the dropdown, which would let you create a group if you don't see one that fits what you want.</p>
<p>I think that approach still leaves some questions, like how we would avoid clutter/confusion from the custom groups created this way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is probably the key question -- if we're going to stick with our plan of having you select a single group, then the widget can just be one of our dropdown list widgets to select which group you want.</p>

<p>I think the plan of having the thing you select be a single group (that may contain subgroups) is attractive in many ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>From an API perspective, we have a <code>users_who_can_do_x_group</code> value for each setting using this system, and that is just the ID of a single group. This is pretty important because we're probably going to end up with like 30 settings with this structure, so having each be represented by a single integer is helpful.</li>

<p>Ok, so to break it down into mergeable milestones, we could:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Replace the stream post permissions drop-down with a dropdown with filtering, which we'll want to do on the assumption that the list can in the future be quite long. Perhaps this can be the same as what we use for the "New stream notifications" dropdown? At this point, we may actually want to keep the group names the same as now, e.g. "Admins and moderators" as the name for the moderators group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add non-system groups to a dropdown. We probably want to sort the system groups above other groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify the "Add new user group" modal to allow adding members to the group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a "New group" option to the dropdown, which would pop up the "Add new user group" modal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make it possible to add subgroups to groups.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Does that sound like a good sequence of steps?</p>

<p>The one concern I have is that changing the API for stream post permissions could be something that gets bogged down in API change logistics; I'm not sure if mobile reads that property, but if it does, then it might be a messy API change to manage.</p>
<p>If that is an issue that risks bogging this down, we should just pick a new setting off our TODO list for the area and add that instead.</p>

<p>I checked the code for mobile and terminal. From what I understand, they currently use <code>is_announcement_value</code> to check whether to allow user to post to a stream or not. Other cases are handled by server. But I can see there are open PRs, to replace it with using <code>stream_post_policy</code>. Using new setting would be fine I think. There are many settings mentioned in the issue, something like "users who can unsubscribe others" setting can be fine.</p>

<p>Hmm, the advantage of doing the stream post policy setting was that it's not next to any other settings that would look different during the intermediate stage.</p>
<p>Maybe if we're need to do a setting under org permissions, we can pick one that's towards the bottom of the list? E.g. <strong>Who can create and manage user groups</strong>.</p>

<p>I was talking about the "users who can unsubscribe others from this stream", i.e. setting for a particular stream, as it is mentioned in the "Stream settings" section of the issue, which would keep it separate from the org settings UI and the stream post policy would only be one setting that would look different.</p>

<p>I don't have a clear opinion on how to handle the "create a new user group" option. I think for v1, I'd just skip that detail, since it'll probably be easier to play with options for adding it when that's the only thing we're changing.</p>

<p>We are running into the following limitation with the permissions system and I was wondering if this work (new permissions model) would cover this before I make a new issue.</p>
<p>One of our moderators was unable to edit the name of a stream (which felt strange to him since he had himself created the stream). It turns out that only administrators are allowed to edit the names of streams - but we try to use the "least-privilege principle" with regards to permissions, so we don't want to make lot's of people admins.</p>
<p>Will this new permissions model allow this kind of fine grained granting of permissions?</p>

<p>The setting we just added is "Who can unsubscribe other users from this stream?" -- chosen largely for simplicity. I think probably one of the next steps we want to do is adding another reasonably simple similar setting in order to figure out how to arrange these settings so one can add new ones mostly through configuration, not adding a bunch of new code. A possible candidate is "Who can subscribe other users to this stream"? That has two advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don't currently have a way to control that; it's currently hardcoded to "any subscriber to this stream".</li>
<li>It's similar to the one we just added conceptually.</li>
</ul>
<p>The one thing that is awkward about this is the defaults situation -- the option that users might expect is "Anyone currently subscribed to the stream", and we don't currently have an easy way to represent a stream as a group.</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning that the most important stream setting of this form to add will be "Who can edit the settings for the stream?"; and that has a similar complication -- we probably want the __default__ for that in the "Create stream" UI to be a group containing just the user who is creating that stream.</p>
<p>So I'm pondering whether we will want to have implicitly maintained user groups for "Individual user X" and "Members of stream Z" similar to the system groups that we have for "Users with role X".</p>

<p>That said, I want to emphasize that most of our existing settings are global settings for the organization where these issues don't apply, so likely we should not block progress on adding organization settings pointing to groups (or reworking existing ones to be based on groups) on this issue.</p>

<p>I guess one other detail to note on the stream settings front is that the definition for "Who can remove other subscribers from this stream?" has some implicit quirks:</p>
<ul>
<li>(You can always remove yourself from a stream)</li>
<li>Organization administrators can remove anyone from any stream that they can see exists. (Which is all streams, but one could imagine that changing).</li>
<li>You need to be able to see that the stream exists and view its subscribers in order to use this permission. In practice, for non-admins, this means that either you are a subscriber or the stream is public and you can access public streams (i.e., you are not a guest) and thus you could become a subscriber if you wanted to.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those quirks around access to the stream correspond to "Can you see any UI that would offer to let you unsubscribe other users".</p>

<p>So, a possible option for the default group for "Who can add subscribers to this stream?" that would be equivalent to today's "Any subscriber" would be "Any user in this organization" -- in that the "are you a subscriber, or able to become one?" part is implicit.</p>

<p>The thing which I don't like about that is that those sets being equivalent relies on our not changing the permissions model in the future to make "Streams that you can view the subscribers of" different from "Streams that you can join by clicking a button without anyone else adding you". But maybe that's OK for a default that we would set today; we can worry about those issues if/when we split those definitions, and explain whatever the mechanics are clearly to users.</p>

<p>For private streams with our current stream permissions model, yes. For public streams, it would not be accurate -- because members (who can join the stream but are not subscribed) and are in the group can do the action. Also administrators can, but that's independent of this setting.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that we have the longer-term ambition to create a <code>StreamGroup</code> layer, which will likely include a setting of the form "Which users can join any stream in this group without being invited", and a very reasonable use case is to have a cluster of 12 private streams that members of a given group can access, without requiring members of that group to be subscribed to those streams at all times. In that setting, I expect at least some private streams might feature the same complication.</p>
<p>One possible answer is to not worry about that for now and change the strings when we get there (or change them when we have a "who can access this stream" setting right next to that defines that term).</p>

<p>Just a thought - can we create a new table with a field like <code>type</code> and a field like <code>type_id</code> which can be id of a UserProfile, UserGroup or Stream. Basically something similar to the <code>Recipient</code> table that we have currently. And then the setting will be set to an object of new table.</p>

<p>Having thought about this a bit more, I think we may well want to do the "Group that's just user X" class of system group that's implicitly generated in some cases -- could be named something like <code>@user:17</code> with their user ID -- for this use case of "making the creator of a stream have permissions on that stream". But I think if we use the right definition for settings on a stream (where users need both access to the stream and to be in the permission group), I'm not sure we'll actually have a use case for "this stream's members" as a category for these settings -- you'd represent that as using the "Everyone" group.</p>

<p>Some of this might be basic and intutive, but would still mention it here as it would save us time if they are discussed here.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can add a new field like <code>default_group_name</code> to the existing <code>GroupPermissionSetting</code> type. This will be store the default group name for all realm-level group based settings.</li>
<li>And then we can create a function to set the defaults for all the settings in <code>do_create_realm</code>. </li>
<li>I am not sure whether we want to use the existing <code>do_set_realm_property</code> function to set the group-based settings or have a new function. I guess new function would be better since we would anyways have a different object simialr to existing <code>property_types</code>object for group based settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also noting here that the feedback on <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/24762">#24762</a> might be helpful while implementing this setting.</p>

<p>All these points sounds reasonable to me. Regarding setting default for existing realms do we will be creating three migrations just like we have <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/main/zerver/migrations/0408_stream_can_remove_subscribers_group.py">migration_408</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/main/zerver/migrations/0409_set_default_for_can_remove_subscribers_group.py">migration_409</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/main/zerver/migrations/0410_alter_stream_can_remove_subscribers_group.py">migration_410</a> which were added while adding the stream level setting <code>Who can unsubscribe others </code> ?</p>

<p>I think for groups fields being <code>None</code>: From a product perspective, they should never be <code>None</code> - we use the "nobody" group to encode that state. But in the database layer, we probably will need to declare them as allowing <code>None</code> in <code>models.py</code> because of that data import sequence issue, and just enforce in application code that we never expose to the application a state where one of these fields is <code>None</code>; in practice this probably involves adding a bunch of <code>assert realm.foo_group_id is not None</code> when we're going to access one of these fields.</p>

<p>Foreign key constraints can be deferred to the end of a transaction, and I believe Django does this by default, allowing the construction of circular references. We shouldn’t need the column to be nullable just for that.</p>

<p>Yeah I guess the question is whether we can make the early part of the data import process one transaction; we'd have to import all the groups for the new realm. Probably ok; it's separable steps like importing membership where we might not want to hold locks a long time.</p>

<p>So, proceeding with the above approach of not allowing null. Now, suppose a new realm is getting created through the view function. We have to do the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new <code>Realm </code>model instance.</li>
<li>Create system groups for the new realm.</li>
<li>Make all the groups fields in realm model to their default groups.</li>

<p>As the fields will be non-nullable we have to provide a value to group fields while the realm is created in step 1. So , will it fine if I give a dummy value say -1, in step 1 and later those values will be changed in step 3 and all the three steps will be done in a single transaction.</p>

<p>So <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/25928">#25928</a> is a new issue that specs our the single-user group concept. Posting some noted on how I think that should work here for reference/visibility:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think we want <code>is_system_group=True</code> for these groups -- the idea being that they exist as an internals detail to allow us to have menus offering a "single user" or "single group" while still being able to be stored as a <code>setting_name_group_id</code>. (I feel like we had a #design conversation about this that we can refer to). And <code>is_system_group</code> should enable a lot of the policy things we want to have like not being editable in terms of either their settings or membership.</p>
<p>I think ideally from a data storage standpoint, we'd arrange things such that these groups are created on-demand when someone wants to use it in a setting (rather than when a user is created, which would entail increasing how many groups exist by a huge number, with all the clutter both in the database and the API that comes with that). The main downside of that is that we'll need to do something a bit awkward in the API to allow clients to request that such a group be created. Options include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding a "get details for this group by name" endpoint that we'd query with "user:{user_id}" from the client that would have a success continuation of submitting the actual API request using the obtained group ID.</li>
<li>Making all of our permissions settings that accept a <code>group_id</code> also accept a group name string of this form.</li>
</ul>
<p>I kinda prefer the second option, because it likely will make it easier for us to ensure the auto-creation step only happens if the acting user actually has permission to set a setting that it's needed for.</p>
<p>But in either case, the idea would be that we'd auto-create these system groups when they are explicitly needed for a permission; the end result should be that an organization like <a href="http://chat.zulip.org">chat.zulip.org</a> with 25K users probably has &lt;50 of these <code>user:{user_id}</code> groups rather than 25K of them, and that seems worth doing some work to arrange.</p>
<p>We should probably post this technical proposal in "api design" for feedback before committing to implementing this as written.</p>

<p>I also posted a reply on <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/25928">#25928</a>. Just re-posting here again for visibility -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having is_system_group=True for these groups sounds good as we would not want them to be editable by membership. I am not sure about them being not editable by settings though, as some of the organizations would want to have different value set for settings like "Who can mention this user group" for role based system groups. But we might not want to allow settings for single-user groups though.</p>
<p>Regarding the API and data storage details, I like the idea of creating the groups only when required sounds good and I agree that second option to make settings accept group name along with group ID is better. One point that we might need to think of is what we would do if a user is allowed to chagne a setting but not allowed to create user groups.</p>

<p>I think giving <code>None</code> will be a good idea. This will also require us to add a logic in <code>check_add_user_group</code> that if value of <code>can_manage_group</code> received in function parameter is <code>None</code> than a single user_group corresponding to <code>acting_user</code> will be set for <code>can_manage_group</code> field. But we are calling <code>check_add_user_group</code> in various tests too and currently we are passing <code>None</code> for <code>acting_user</code>. So following the above approach will entail an additional task to always pass a valid user while calling the function in test .</p>

<p>This way, before <code>can_mention_group</code> is ever changed, we still have an audit log of how the initial value came about.</p>

<p>Alternatively, we can track that setting in the creation event and populate extra data without reusing the <code>USER_GROUP_GROUP_BASED_SETTING_CHANGED</code> event. I guess this might make more sense to avoid violating the null constraint?</p>

<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/25929">#25929</a> we also want to show option of group creator while assigning permission for who can manage this group. For this we need a new field <code>group_creator</code> in <code>UserGroup</code> table. I have following questions regarding this field:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Should we allow it to be <code>null</code>?  If not than what value should be given to this field for role based system groups.</li>

<p>Ok, I had missed that part of having the <code>Group creator</code> option. Sounds good to add this field then.</p>
<p>One option can be set the creator field for role-based system groups to the user who created the realm. But this might be problematic when that user is deactiveted.</p>
<p>I think we would also consider single-user group as system group, for those we can set them to the user itself. But am not sure.</p>

<p>One more question regarding implementing API changes. As the parameter <code>can_manage_group</code> will be accepting both string and integer I added the following in arguments list of view function:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>    can_manage_group_id: Optional[Union[int, str]] = REQ(
        &quot;can_manage_group&quot;, json_validator=check_string_or_int, default=None
    ),
</code></pre></div>
<p>It works fine. But now whenever we want to give string value to this field we have to call <code>JSON.stringify()</code> in client before sending data to server. Currently in frontend we don't do this. So we have to write some additional logic for passing data to server in this case.</p>

<p>Just to be clear I believe the intent was to have an option in the UI called <code>group_creator</code>, not a database field -- if you select that option, we'd send a request to the server for this field to have the <code>user:{your_user_id}</code> system group as its administrator group. (And the server would presumably create that group for you if it doesn't already exist).</p>

<p>Yeah, but while changing this setting for an existing group it may be possible that the user changing the setting is different from one who created the group. So, in this case we need to send <code>user_id</code> of group creator and not <code>user_id</code> of the user changing the setting. So, a field <code>group_creator</code> will be required in database.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="24860">@Ujjawal Modi</span> the intent is that the data model will support setting any user's system group as the owner of a group, and we're likely to offer that option in the menu in the medium term. I am not sure what the source of confusion is here, but maybe you're under the impression that we want to <strong>only</strong> allow the group's creator system group to used in this setting? That isn't the intent, it's just a temporary UI simplification.</p>

<p>But if we want the latter one than I think there is need to store group creator. Because in that case client will send a string of form <code>user: {group_creator_id}</code> to server. So, client need to determine the <code>group_creator_id</code> and I think there is no way for client to determine it other than storing  it in database and sending it to client with UserGroup object.</p>

<p>In the initial version, we might not do the UI work to make it possible to change it to another individual user -- you'd have to just make a group to do that.

<p>And to be clear I expect we'll be adding "non-system group X" fairly soon after this transition, once we feel good about the overall security model.</p>

<p>One question I have do we want to allow all users who can manage the group to be able to delete the group also or we need a separate setting for configuring deletion permissions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That can be controlled by the same setting -- this is a "full edit" capability.</p>

<p>I have one more question regarding <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/25929">#25929</a> about the value that should be stored in <code>data-unique-id</code> field of dropdown widget options for the case when the user group corresponding to option does not exist and we will be passing the string to server. Should we store the string that will be passed to server in this case ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think storing a group ID integer (if it's a group like a system group that we already have data on) or a string like <code>user:16</code> that we would pass to the server would be a fine option here, yeah.</p>

<p>Just bumping the discussion <a href="#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/New.20permissions.20model/near/1612949">here</a> as we don't have any conclusion for creating a separate audit log entry of type <code>USER_GROUP_GROUP_BASED_SETTING_CHANGED</code> when a user group is created.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="24860">@Ujjawal Modi</span> I think that behavior might be a bug? <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="12178">@Alex Vandiver</span> should correct me if he disagrees, but I think there's no reason to create audit log entries with the initial values of a setting; we don't do that for the initial value of stream settings, for example, and I think the <code>OLD_VALUE/NEW_VALUE</code> scheme allows one to get the initial values if they've since changed.</p>

<p>I think currently we don't have the standard of making an audit log entry for the state of an object at creation time.  There are ways in which having that consistent property is useful, in that you can always determine the current state just by looking at the audit log entries, and it's easier to detect drift in cases where things change properties without properly making audit log entries.</p>
<p>But it's not <em>currently</em> our pattern, so we should probably be internally consistent and not generate the audit log entry on creation.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/10970">#10970</a>, we are planning to have a "Who can access all users in the realm" group setting with "Everyone" and "Members and above" as option. Discussion - <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="101" href="/#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/access.20to.20all.20users.20in.20realm.20.2310970">#design &gt; access to all users in realm #10970</a>.</p>
<p>So, I wanted to discuss do we want to consider updating <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/1765ce23b0591e41c8a65fd92233da38b8972622/zerver/lib/types.py#L285"><code>GroupPermissionType</code></a> to have a parameter like <code>allowed_system_groups</code> as parameter instead of adding more boolean fields like <code>allow_moderators_group</code>, <code>allow_full_members_group</code>. I remember about mentioning about this before as well but we decided to keep using the boolean fields and think about passing a list of allowed groups when required in future.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="10242">@Sahil Batra</span> yeah this might be a situation that makes a good case for passing in a list of allowed groups.</p>

<p>One other option to instead pass a list of disallowed groups. I am not sure what would be better. I guess in most cases the list of disallowed groups would be shorter though.</p>

<p>We can potentially just for now add allowed groups as an optional parameter, and if not specified have no restrictions from that parameter, and keep the existing options.</p>

<p>Just to minimize the churn while we're figuring out what we want.</p>
