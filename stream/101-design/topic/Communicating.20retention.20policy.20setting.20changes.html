<p>The current message retention policy (<a href="https://zulip.com/help/message-retention-policy">https://zulip.com/help/message-retention-policy</a>) UX has the flaw that changing it  is like changing any other org/stream setting - rather "quiet". Which is not great, because the effects of accidentally activating retention policy and not noticing can be... well, very bad <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span> So as <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="7">Tim Abbott</span>  mentioned elsewhere we have a couple of options for improving this, such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Having an additional, aggressive confirmation dialog before changing the global message retention policy.</li>
<li>Sending a notification of some sort (e.g. an email or a Zulip message to the notifications stream?) to all administrators when message retention policies are changed for an organization.  Or possibly a Zulip messages to the "stream events" topic for a stream when it's changed for an individuals stream.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoughts on this? Arguably we should do both - a popup for the person changing the setting and then getting it communicated to other users. Not sure if there's a reason to limit this to administrators, perhaps we should do it in a way that gets all users notified? (sending a <code>Notification bot</code> message to the affected stream/streams would accomplish this)</p>

<p>I think both a confirmation dialog box to the person changing it, and a notification for others, would be good.</p>

<p>Perhaps a message to stream events when it's changed for an individual stream, and to announcements (the same place a new stream would go) when it's changed globally?</p>

<p>Yeah, I think such stream events notices makes sense for changes to an individual stream's settings.</p>

<p>For the global settings, I think we can post to the "new streams" notification stream, if configured; if not, we don't have a way to post to an announcement stream from code.  That seems OK.</p>

<p>So I think we open two issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>One for adding those two automated notifications from Notification Bot.</li>
<li>One for making changing the global message retention policy have a confirmation modal similar to what we have for deactivating your organization.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does that sound good?</p>
