<p>Continuing the discussion from <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="6" href="/#narrow/stream/6-frontend/topic/.2310886.20Avoid.20marking.20messages.20read">#frontend &gt; #10886 Avoid marking messages read</a> ...<br>
This is the change I'm proposing for the date change rows.<br>
( The GIF contains both sticky message and sticky date change headers. )</p>
<p><a href="/user_uploads/2/f5/CMVeIQBsTFEwLEfOuO1cekyN/sticky_date_change.gif">sticky_date_change.gif</a> </p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/f5/CMVeIQBsTFEwLEfOuO1cekyN/sticky_date_change.gif" title="sticky_date_change.gif"><img src="/user_uploads/2/f5/CMVeIQBsTFEwLEfOuO1cekyN/sticky_date_change.gif"></a></div><p>Although using the sticky date change headers is not a blocker for that issue (only sticky message headers are).<br>
Using this we could eliminate the <code>floating_recipient_bar.js</code> file. (Would include <a href="https://github.com/ryanreh99/zulip/commit/ac73075ef5bb1e73d788efcb5ef0660f87a7a58a">structure changes</a> to the message table component . )</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="13033">@Ryan Rehman</span> interesting; what's the thinking around the bold/black color around the date and what does the down-triangle button do?</p>

<p>I would want to preserve the existing visual styling of the dates, but the scrolling UX lgtm aside from the corner cases where the date header doesn't seem to agree with the topic part of the header (which just looks off).</p>

<p>I mainly added the block around the dates to handle the gap between recipient rows.<br>
So while scrolling quickly the block remains mostly  constant and the text within changes,<br>
else the dates looked like they were flickering as they passed between the gaps.</p>
<p>I just added a temporary color scheme taken from private message header.<br>
So that it matches for both private message and stream rows (in All messages view).</p>
<p>And the down arrow, is there to signify all messages below this point have this date.</p>

<p>Maybe we could improve the UI so that it looks like the element is floating and came from the right.</p>

<p>I think we don't need the down arrow to signal that; it's the intuitive meaning of that symbol, and it makes me think I'm supposed to click there.</p>

<p>I'm not sure I understand -- can you make a WIP PR showing this issue so that it's easy to see for myself?</p>
