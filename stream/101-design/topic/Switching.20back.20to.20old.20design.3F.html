<p>Heya, I found the new design to be suddenly active on my web client this morning, and while I appreciate the work that went into it, I really liked the old one more (because it was more compact an concise). Is there a way to switch back to the old design on a per-user basis?</p>

<p>Why is zooming out not an option? I don’t think that there is a switch for per user bases. I know that there is plan to do font-size control in the new design which will allow the UI to be small.</p>

<p>There aren't any changes to the font size in what was released yesterday; the main difference is in the height of the headers in between topics.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="23851">@Urs Ganse</span> it's not possible for us to support both the old and new designs simultaneously; there's too many subtle changes to the layout in the redesign to make that viable. But I'd like to talk about options we can offer that might help with compactness. I'm going to write up some numbers comparing the two, but can you talk a bit about how you use Zulip (E.g. do you use interleaved views like "all messages" view a lot?)?</p>

<p>Just to lay out some of the numbers for discussion, the design changes released last night have the following impact on density:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single-line message from the same sender as the previous message is about the same height.</li>
<li>A single-line message with a new sender (i.e. there's a sender name + avatar shown) is 49px in height; previously it was 51px, so that's about the same as before.</li>
<li>A single line message that's the first in a topic and thus includes colored "recipient bar" at the top is 90px in height in this design; previously this was 74px (both before and after there's 10px of margin below these before the next one). One can account for those 16px as follows:<br>
    * The bar at the top went from 24px to 30px (and from 22px =&gt; 30px for private messages; I have no idea why it was previously 2px shorter before).<br>
    * There's 5px of new padding between the recipient bar and the top of the first message in a recipient group. This was required to support the cleaner/thinner blue box design -- because it's no longer on the outside edge of the message, it needs to have a space to sit where it's not hitting either the top of the message (where we display the sender) or the recipient bar; both of which would look ugly.<br>
    * There's 5px of new padding after the very last message in a recipient group. This is added for the same reason of the top padding.</li>
</ul>

<p>For context, here's what this conversation would look like if we undid all 16px of those added paddings. </p>

<p>I don't think offering a "dense mode" setting that looks like that would feel great. Removing completely the two 5px top/bottom paddings looks ugly if you actually look at the details when the first/last message is selected. I think it's possible there's a version somewhere in between might support a viable "dense mode", but I'm not sure; certainly when played with changing the recipient bar height from 30px to 26px, that looks passable as a "dense mode", but is only saving 4px, so doesn't seem worth bothering with a setting for.</p>
<p>I'd like to understand more deeply the motivation for wanting more density -- if the problem is JUST in search views, for example, I'd want to consider making a tweak to how to do those for everyone just for those views. Certainly search views have this overhead around every single message they display.</p>

<p>Just to show what that 5px top/bottom padding is about, here's a screenshot with the bottom padding reduces to 1px -- you can see that the blue box is inset from the sides of the message by 5px on the left and right, but only 1px on the bottom, and it looks off as a result. (It's a bit harder to see in the dark theme and also a bit less visible in the symmetric place at the top of the feed).</p>

<p>I don't think zooming out is responsive to the concern -- we haven't changed the font size, just how much space there is between blocks of text in interleaved views. I had to do the analysis above to confirm my understanding, but I think we've actually as of this checkpoint increased the density of messages within a single topic by a few percent. My guess is that the user's concern has to do with interleaved views and/or search views, where density is considerably less.</p>

<p>We should also keep in mind that gut reactions to a design change often have a certain amount of general human change aversion, and folks may change their opinion after a few days of using it. I don't want to dismiss complaints as that by any means, but do want to set context that even design changes that prove popular sometimes get pushback, because anything you're used to looking different suddenly can feel bad.</p>
