<p>I believe it could be useful to improve the onboarding tips in the following way:</p>
<p>Instead of showing all the tips at the moment the user starts using the app I believe we could be more intelligent about when we show a particular tip. For example, we could set certain conditions in order for a tip to be displayed -<br>
If a user just started using the app we could stagger the tips in a smart way. Like maybe show them 1 or at most 2 tips at the very beginning and then slowly introducing increasingly advanced features over time. </p>
<p>I've been using a couple of apps that do this and its actually really nice because it doesn't feel like you're bombarded with hints at the very beginning and also gives you time to get to grips with the UI before introducing more advanced ideas.</p>

<p>which ones of the current list do you think we should move to later? The hotspots system supports this pretty easily.</p>

<p>I'd have to take another look but I do remember feeling a bit overwhelmed and dismissing them all when I first saw them. I believe this would also allow us to introduce shortcuts and other more advanced features.</p>
