<p>Hey! I just filed <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/25612">#25612</a> for a feature where users would be able to name group DM conversations. Not marked as "help wanted" for now, and feedback is definitely appreciated -- it just felt easier to communicate the proposal as an issue rather than a series of messages here.</p>

<p>My proposal is to just do this for group DM, as I think naming 1:1 DMs is more likely to be confusing than helfpful.</p>

<p>I have always thought that group DMs should be able to be upgraded to either private or public streams.  History has shown that that idea doesn't really resonate with folks, at least not well enough to get developers interested in it.</p>

<p>This seems like a more pragmatic approach to the problem.</p>

<p>I would probably use this feature in Zulip, although I don't feel a  compelling personal need for it.  Group DMs are more annoying for me on my iPhone, and the iPhone doesn't seems to solve this, but maybe I am overlooking something.</p>

<p>I think if Alya's proposal were implemented, then it would actually help toward having a DM-&gt;stream migration path.  (I said that my ideas there didn't resonate much with other people, but we do have some old issues from folks wanting some kind of path from DMs to streams, once a conversation settles.)</p>

<p>IMHO I <strong>still</strong> think the real problem here is that there is too much friction toward just using private streams.</p>

<p>I was on a group DM recently with Alya that wasn't super private, so I think we can discuss it in general terms.  I wonder what her optimal experience would have been for that.  I suppose just renaming the conversation would have worked for her, and it probably would have worked for me.  I eventually just moved the conversation to a stream, which is actually kinda easy, but I don't think most newbies would have done that.</p>

<p>Executive summary: I support this idea a lot.</p>

<p>Just being able to annotate conversations in general is a path that I think Zulip should really pursue.  We have definitely gotten feedback from users on that.</p>

<p>I would use some kind of annotation feature far more for topics than group DMs, but I don't how representative of a user I am in that regard.</p>

<p>I would imagine the implementation mechanics would be basically the same.</p>

<p>Users also want to annotate individual messages, and that usually is framed in terms of being able to do something a little more powerful than starring a message.</p>

<p>Ah, thanks for tracking that down.  There are probably five or six pretty well-thought-out issues that are in this general space.</p>
<p>I like your most recent issue in terms of it just being a simple way to make forward progress.  Even though I don't find <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/25612">#25612</a> compelling in terms of my own personal use cases, I feel like it will help toward the broader goal of being able to annotate topics, messages, etc.</p>

<p>And to be clear, "compelling" is a high bar.  I would use the feature.</p>

<p>I updated a related user request issue to make it actionable: <strong>Hide direct message conversations</strong> <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/11842">#11842</a>. Feedback on that one is appreciated as well.</p>
<p>Note that there's a part that's definitely underspecified:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Open question: We probably want some kind of visual indicator for which conversations are hidden. But using fading seems like a bad idea, as we want to make it clear that this feature is quite different from muting topics/streams.</p>
