<p>I opened up this conversation here related to a feature about pinned messages, <br>
<a href="#narrow/stream/137-feedback/topic/pinned.20messages.3F/near/742129" title="#narrow/stream/137-feedback/topic/pinned.20messages.3F/near/742129">https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/137-feedback/topic/pinned.20messages.3F/near/742129</a></p>
<p>Considering that discord implements pinned messages like this:<br>
<a href="user_uploads/2/5c/dhIxOv8g6aJvBBWaX-zC1ztE/pasted_image.png" target="_blank" title="user_uploads/2/5c/dhIxOv8g6aJvBBWaX-zC1ztE/pasted_image.png">https://chat.zulip.org/user_uploads/2/5c/dhIxOv8g6aJvBBWaX-zC1ztE/pasted_image.png</a></p>

<a href="user_uploads/2/21/NXiE0Y-qw6aN--lSCzh2ytHf/pasted_image.png" target="_blank" title="user_uploads/2/21/NXiE0Y-qw6aN--lSCzh2ytHf/pasted_image.png">https://chat.zulip.org/user_uploads/2/21/NXiE0Y-qw6aN--lSCzh2ytHf/pasted_image.png</a></p>

<p>My idea is that we have this modal at a topic level and have a search for "is:pinned" at the stream level. (and possibly an icon that will direct us to this "is:pinned" filter in the new navbar).</p>
<p>An alternative is that we have pinned messages only at the stream level and either have this modal and icon placed in the new navbar next to the search icon, or have an icon in the new navbar that directs to an "is:pinned".</p>
<p>I'd like to know the general opinion about this direction.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="9808">@Yash RE</span> I think our current thinking is to not spend time on "pinned messages" as a concept until we've merged the navbar redesign.  I think a lot of what people want "pinned messages" for could be done via the navbar.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="9808">@Yash RE</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="19257">@Alya Abbott</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="21453">@Evy Kassirer</span> I think it's timely to resurrect the concept of pinned messages, if only to give us some food for thought on how to implement pinned topics.  As Yash mentions above, Discord already has the concept of pinned messages.  And the main blocker for continuing this discussion from 2019 is no longer relevant--we now have the new navbar design which always shows the stream description.</p>
<p>I am going to re-brand the concept and move it to <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="137" href="/#narrow/stream/137-feedback/topic/welcome.20message">#feedback &gt; welcome message</a></p>

<p>To be clear, you're advocating for a very specific model of pinned messages, and I believe that neither Discord or Slack has the concept of a welcome message in a channel (which isn't to say it wouldn't be a helpful feature).</p>
<p>Discord and Slack allow you to pin messages for further reference by clicking on the pins icon.</p>
<p>Here's an example from <a href="/user_uploads/2/ce/v1Rzl49qQNilHXxHsVzI6iFm/image.png">my house's Discord</a> and <a href="/user_uploads/2/94/Zb6iBoTqI6dYxkW7kcyvstRL/image.png">a Slack</a> (for the people who build and program patterns for those light up trees in SF's Golden Gate Park).</p>

<p>I think that this particular feature is important for Zulip because it's common in competitors and is a generally useful feature. The pins here are globally pinned for all users and can be referenced at any time by looking at the list of pinned messages for a channel. I'm not sure if we'd want to do that on a stream level or a topic level.</p>

<p>That said, I actually would prefer to not spend a bunch of time/attention on discussing designs for pinned messages right now, since I think it's easier to design things when we're planning to work on them more immediately.</p>

<p>Sorry for still getting the hang of the flow of idea --&gt; feature, but what conversations are necessary to lead to an issue that someone later picks up to work on more immediately (which would lead to more design discussion)?</p>

<p>I obviously disagree with Tim’s approach here, with all due respect.  We should spend time chucking around ideas.  Brainstorming is a highly leveraged process, especially with smart folks involved.  Coding is expensive.</p>

<p>I don't want to discourage folks chatting about potential feature ideas.  But <a class="stream" data-stream-id="101" href="/#narrow/stream/101-design">#design</a> is the stream for design changes that we're actively working on, and starting a conversation about a major new feature here (and pushing for a concrete design) is implicitly a request that I invest significant time in the design discussion around that feature. It's established that we want to do some sort of pinned messages feature at some point.</p>

<p>And that doesn't ask for a lot of time. We have a few dozen features that are of a similar level of complexity to pinned messages with varying states of existing work having happened on them. We usually do periodic processes to figure out which we want to do major investments in. I expect the next such larger conversation to happen after the 5.0 release is out the door.</p>

<p>That makes sense. Two followup Qs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a better stream for people throwing ideas around that aren't expected to necessarily be implemented, and that don't need as much involvement from you?</li>
<li>Is there an existing issue for adding pinned messages that someone could pick up at some point? Or do you deliberately want to postpone someone picking it up because you'd want to involved and can't invest in that right now?</li>
