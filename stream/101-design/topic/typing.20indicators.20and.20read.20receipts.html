<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="13362">Dinesh Ch</span> is working on adding typing indicators for streams messages (<a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/17040">#17040</a>) and read receipts (<a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/15032">#15032</a>).  </p>
<p>I'd like to start a conversation about what we want on the privacy side of these features.  I think in line with our general privacy-friendly model, we probably want to allow users to disable sharing of read receipts and typing notifications for their account.  Thoughts?</p>

<p>Agreed that we should have a setting. Especially for read receipts... Typing notifications seem less important, in that if you actually send the message, it doesn't provide a huge amount of additional information. But probably worth doing regardless.</p>

<p>I think there's a few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we want just on/off, or also a "On for PMs, not for stream messages" additional state?</li>
<li>What do we want to call this setting?</li>
<li>For typing notifications, the semantics are clear if the setting is disabled; you just don't send anything.  </li>
<li>For "who has read this message", which we're currently for data synchronization scaling planning to only offer on explicit request (i.e. you click something to fetch and see it, not it appears by default, though we could do that for groups up to 20 or so if we wanted to).  We might need to decide whether to indicate who has disabled the setting, to avoid it looking like a bug.  ("How did Tim reply to this message if he hasn't seen it?")</li>
</ul>

<p>That makes sense to me.</p>
<p>Though on a related topic, should we move this section of the menu? It's currently under <strong>Notifications</strong>, which I generally interpret as, "how I get notifed about things", not "how other users get notifed about what I do". Perhaps <strong>You account</strong> is a better place for it?</p>

<p>I don't think that'd be an improvement; "Your account" has a highly variable amount of custom profile fields that makes it hard to place other things on it.  And currently everything on that page is part of your profile, whereas these settings are not.</p>

<p>I agree that "notifications" is a pretty surprising place to find these settings, or that existing presence setting. Surprising enough that if there was a setting like this that defaulted to on (less private), and I wanted to turn off (more private), I could easily see feeling deceived about it.</p>
<p>"Your account" seems like a less bad place than that -- not like deceptively hiding anything, at least. But still not a good fit.</p>

<p>Twitter has "Settings and privacy" and within that "Privacy and safety". Discord also does "Privacy and safety". Checking half a dozen or so other sites didn't find anybody else that put anything even that similar together, so who knows.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what a good UI for this would be when a bunch of people disable the setting being in a stream with a lot of subscribers if we want them to be displayed in the UI element(which should perhaps look something like typeahead list with scroll) where we show "read by these users" list. Perhaps a note at the bottom of list saying something like "we don't show read indicators for people who've disabled them" would be good?</p>

<p>My thinking about hovering a timestamp as not a great idea is that there's no way we can convey "zulip supports read indicators and you can hover over the timestamp to see who read your message" from the UI but people might discover that accidentally hovering over it if they didn't know.</p>

<p>We could also have the read-by users' list be similar to the UI of the user suggestions list we show on trying to do <code>@</code> mentions with a scroll but that will probably look odd if we are opening it from the three-dots menu but may be fine if we display it with hover on timestamp.</p>

<p>I think a popover accessed via the 3-dots menu is probably fine for an initial version.  I'm not certain that this will be a popular enough feature to justify something else.</p>

<p>We're talking about the UI for seeing read receipts, right?</p>
<p>I'd be concerned about having that feature be hard to discover so that it feels hidden, in any org where it's enabled. That seems like a recipe for people to feel like their privacy was violated.</p>

<p>In chat products I've used where read receipts are present (that I know of!), they're visible all the time.</p>
<p>The ones I can think of are all basically SMS-style: FB Messenger, WhatsApp, IIRC Signal, plus the SMS-but-fancier-where-possible system apps like iMessage.</p>

<p>Hmm, that's a fair point.</p>
<p>It's seems fairly useful for PMs, but I'd be pretty worried about it just being clutter for stream messages. I suppose we <em>could</em> just have the feature for PMs and make it always-visible there.</p>

<p>Looking back at <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/15032">#15032</a>, the person filing that issue was specifically interested in read receipts on @-mentions, presumably mainly in streams. They included this screenshot of what that apparently looks like in Flowdock:<br>

<p>That issue also links to a previous issue thread <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/3618">#3618</a>. That thread got kind of chaotic with discussion of a bounty, but I think at least some people there are definitely hoping to get the feature in stream threads.</p>
<p>One of them specifically describes the kind of UI I've seen for this in several apps that seems to work well:</p>

<p>We are moving from Google Hangouts to Zulip and would love to see something along these lines. In Hangouts, there are little floating avatars for each user that indicates where the message stream was at when they last viewed it.</p>

<p>One possible direction could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>find a UI that makes it always visible and works well for a small number of users -- like take that classic UI and adapt it somehow to our world of interleaved views and non-consecutive unreads</li>
<li>then have the feature apply only when the number of subscribed users is small enough, both in streams and PMs</li>
<li>plus also do something specifically for @-mentions, like in the screenshot above.</li>

<p>I guess you're referring to only the idea of showing all users who read a particular message in a stream but not to just have them for <code>@</code> mentions. Could you confirm? I think <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="19257">Alya Abbott</span>'s suggestion of making it a feature for only PMs and mentions makes sense with the justification of if someone cares about a particular person reading their message, they can @mention them.</p>
<p>Quadratic scaling issues of sending read notification to all members in the stream reading the message to all others wouldn't be there as we only send that data to all for the very few(one or two) users mentioned. It might be an issue for large group PMs but ideally one would make a private stream instead of a large group PM.</p>
<p>In terms of implementation, it can be similar to typing indicators along with a write to DB(perhaps asynchronously, if it takes time) where</p>
<ul>
<li>a request is sent to <code>/json/read_message</code>(or some better name :) with user_id and message id when mentioned users/users involved in PMs read the message</li>
<li>This data gets forwarded through our events system to the users subscribed to stream/ user(s) in  (group)PM which will be used render read indicator</li>
<li>The above would also trigger a write to the database which can be used to load read indicators when the app is first opened.</li>
</ul>
<p>Does it make sense?</p>

<p>Going through <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/3618">#3618</a> again, Use case of read indicators mostly seem to be concerning a single person reading the message which I kind of inferred from [this comment] saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Read receipts enable the message sender to stop thinking about a problem, and move on. With distributed teams, we frequently need to know "Does person X know about this problem?" When we have a read receipt, we can put our mind at ease, and move on. If too much time goes by and they have not read the message, we have to make other plans to solve problems.</p>

<p>But <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/3618#issuecomment-381286867">another user</a> who seems to be concerned about many users reading their message has a workaround:</p>

<p>Thinking of the second user's comment above and quadratic scaling issue Tim mentioned, it probably makes sense to only show read indicators to the author of the message. I'm not sure if everyone would be happy with this option but I've seen WhatsApp do that and perhaps signal too does that?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, that's an interesting idea for how to keep down the amount of visual clutter when you aren't paying attention to this feature.</p>
<p>One design direction for those icons could be like "checkmark in unfilled circle" for "some people have read", and then "checkmark in filled circle" for "everyone has read". I feel like that reasonably clearly conveys an order of progression -- especially once you've seen it progress through those stages a few times. (FB Messenger uses these for IIUC "trying to send message" and "message reached server but nobody's read it yet", and then shows little recipient avatars for when the message has been read.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1:1 PMs: A checkmark to indicate it's been read.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it would actually help a lot if we can keep the visuals as similar as possible between 1:1 PMs and group PMs -- that'd help make it feel like one coherent system, and help people figure out how things work because the same patterns get reinforced in each context.</p>

<p>Good questions but I'm not certain what the right solutions are.<br>
For the first, maybe we can just show it as unread in case of group pms and show some sort of notification saying some people might've turned of this feature and in case of mentions and PMs we can probably show some sort of visual indicators conveying that they have it turned off.</p>
<p>For the second, it probably makes sense to consider it as read and show read receipts. Additionally, we can show an alert for the first time a user uses "mark as read" saying that this will be considered as read and shown to other users.</p>

<p>A few thoughts on this:</p>
<ul>
<li>There should be a org-wide setting as to whether this is enabled, which defaults to off, since many people find read receipts creepy/are frustrated when they're added to a app that didn't have them before.</li>
<li>We should consider which of the three types of read receipts people most want, along with the maintenance burden of each one (particularly, the CSS for the @mention read receipts seems sort of complex, although perhaps worth it)</li>
<li>The setting for showing read receipts and sending read receipts should be the same. This is quite standard (I can't think of an app that doesn't do it this way), and it feels sort of creepy for someone to see read receipts but not send them.</li>

<p>Makes sense to me. We should probably aim to get those settings part too done before adding this feature.</p>

<p>FWIW, I think "read receipts" with data synchronization and a WhatsApp-style UI is a lot of work, and likely not an investment that make sense at this time.  The real-time synchronization piece is similar to typing notifications and not too complicated, but we also need to be able to efficiently return the set of users who have read messages in our API requests to fetch 1000 messages of history, and that will look like an additional copy of the Emoji Reactions feature (the issue has notes on a design for that piece).</p>
<p>If we want to have a privacy setting and the simpler "You can get the information with a click if you need" approach, which at least some users on the issue thought would solve their problem, that's a pretty small project, probably 10x less work in Zulip than a WhatsApp-style UI where the "read receipts" status is immediately visible.</p>

<p>Their messages view has a different model where the user received messages float on the left and sent on the right. So, the read indicators need to be shown for the right side ones only which give a consistent look for all the right ones. But our messages view is different and having read indicator(checkmark) for only sent messages in our case makes the UI  odd. So I think there isn't much we can take from Signal or similar apps in terms of UI. Are there professional chat tools like ours offering read indicators? (Slack and rocket chat doesn't seem to provide this)</p>

<p>Having figured the real-time synchronization part, I'm currently trying this which seems a bit complex. Thought it wouldn't require changes in <code>models.py</code> until I read those notes again. so, It would be inefficient without an extra table/ an entry in <code>Message</code>.

<p>Sounds good but we might need to hide that for a received message in PMs and that might look odd. Maybe we should look for a different UI for PMs but it isn't probably ideal to have it different for streams and PMs.</p>
<p>How about something like this:<br>
An icon visible only on hover which can be clicked to show users who read the message just like the star message option. In terms of settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>This defaults to off for every realm.</li>
<li>And an opt-out feature for users which is accessible when the realm level setting is on. (An opt-in feature will make the org admins less happy because they'll have to ask everyone to turn it on and it might get us people asking for it to be turned on by default)</li>
</ul>
<p>When read indicators are enabled in the realm, the notification bot announces that this setting is on and can be disabled on a per-person basis in the settings menu.</p>
<p>This helps us eliminate the issues with UI inconsistencies in trying to implement the WhatsApp kind of UI. It might seem a bit invisible but easily discoverable and the notification bot announcement would definitely help. And also less complicated in terms of implementation with some users agreeing that a 'click to get read-by users' UI would work for them as Tim mentioned.</p>

<p>Hey. I was directed here. :) I think that most users are looking for something very simple and "visual". Take a look at how Rocket.Chat doest. Basically a small indicator of "Received" and "Read" is ideal. Maybe we can have two levels of "Privacy": 1) no read receipts; 2) read receipts.</p>

<p>I've seen a design like this in various apps for 1:1 conversations, and it can work well; but it seems like it breaks down once there are several people involved.

<p>I second this. It's functionality we used in Rocket Chat with our group also, and it would be good to see here in Zulip now that we're using that.</p>
<p>In RC we used in channel messages, say #general it was great to see who had read your note with something time critical like organising a meeting, etc.</p>

<p>Okay, I'll start working towards that.</p>
<p>Yes, we should be a bit concerned about new users joining an org that has it already enabled. Perhaps adding it to the onboarding tutorial/ welcome bot messages is a fine idea but we'd ideally want to keep it minimal. Since we'd only show it for orgs with read receipts enabled, it is OK I think.</p>
<p>And if we are doing something like quill as discussed in <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="101" href="/#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/Welcome.20Bot.20onboarding.20flow">#design &gt; Welcome Bot onboarding flow</a>, which is a great improvement to the onboarding experience,  we can be almost certain that no one will miss existence of read receipts by adding a  short message(conditionally) about them.</p>
<p>(I have a very basic prototype of the earlier discussed real-time sync one. <a href="https://github.com/chdinesh1089/zulip/tree/read_indicators">Just posting a link incase  it'd be helpful in the future in any way.</a>)</p>

<p>1) Direct messages: exactly like WhatsApp treats it, clean and simple. This is, in my opinion, my main reason for people asking for this. If I write something to my colleague, I need to know if he received my message and if he read it, because if he didn't I should contact somebody else.<br>
2) Direct messages with several people. I don't usually do group DMs, because we have channels so why would I group DM?<br>
3) In channels: yes, it's important to know how many colleagues read the very important announcement. In a workplace environment you shouldn't be worried about "your boss knowing if you read the message". It's your boss, or colleague, they <em>should</em> know if you read it or not, because your own actions influence others as well.</p>

<p>I'm thinking of using tippyjs (like we're doing for popovers that is being discussed at <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="6" href="/#narrow/stream/6-frontend/topic/popovers.20-.20tippy">#frontend &gt; popovers - tippy</a> ) to show users who read the message on clicking the icon.</p>

<p>But if you ask me, maybe that's visual clutter? To my mind, it's much more helpful to have an option in the <code>...</code> menu that shows you <em>who</em> has read the message, if you're interested in that information for a specific message. I'm thinking of instances where there are hundreds of users---most often messages are not going to be read by <em>everyone</em> for a very long time (and in some cases, at all) and so a tick indicator like that isn't particularly helpful, but that's my 2c...</p>

<p>Hi all, I think checkmarks would be good too. As for users being able to see other users' read messages info, for our use-case that would be a wanted behaviour, yes. The idea is anyone being able to gauge other people's engagement if they're not writing much, if necessary, is part of what makes read receipts useful (for us at least)... Hope that's helpful!</p>

<p>With double ticks, there's a slight risk of conveying that message is read by everyone. (2) and (4) makes more sense to me. (4) with a few horizontal lines(resembling list) might be perfect to convey "click this to get a list of users who read the message".</p>

<ul>
<li>Changing icon, for now, I just put <code>R</code>.</li>
<li>writing tests</li>
<li>cleaner UI for the read-by-users list.</li>
<li>adding any click functionality to the user list if needed.<br>

<p>I think the 2-line version works pretty well, and I like it the best of those.</p>
<p>The thing that feels like it's missing in the first version is that the rectangle is meant to suggest a message, and doesn't very clearly do so in that version. I figure that's probably why you tried adding the lines. That's a pretty reasonable way to try to do that. Another idea to try might be to make the rectangle a little wider and/or shorter.</p>

<p>To keep this thread updated, the current status of read receipts: I think almost all the work on this is done. What's left is adding a setting to enable/disable sharing these for which there's another PR <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19200">#19200</a> which should be fixed after we merge <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19561">#19561</a>. (Being able to merge those two would also let us integrate the typing indicator for streams PR <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/17040">#17040</a> with settings for that too.)</p>
<p>The current UI looks like <a href="/user_uploads/2/da/okqS1cj3JJoMUAQRoPBgyMbC/zulip_readreceipts.gif">zulip_readreceipts.gif</a>. Scroll is enabled when the number of users exceed 6.

<p>For <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/18935">#18935</a>, I think there are some things we need to play with.</p>
<ol>
<li>Currently, hovering over the icon does nothing. This is different from the icons next to it, where you get a tool tip. Should we have a tool tip on hover for this one as well (e.g. "View read receipts")?</li>
<li>When you click on the icon, you see something flash by very quickly (a loading message?) before the read receipts are loaded, which does not look good. If we want to show a loading indicator, I think we should only do so if it takes significantly longer for the data to load.</li>
<li>When you see the names, it's not really clear what they mean. Perhaps (1) will fix this, but we may want to add a header as well.</li>
<li>I noticed that bots get listed too -- I think we should only include human users.</li>
<li>This is kind of an issue for our tool tips in general, but I think the black background looks too stark in day mode. You can see in the screenshots below that we have a totally different look between day mode and night mode.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks for the valuable feedback <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="19257">Alya Abbott</span> and <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="20503">Jore</span> .</p>

<li>I think sorting alphabetically would be helpful. We do not store when someone read a message (as far as I remember). Also, it would be a lot of data to store..? Perhaps we can try if people find value in having read timestamps.</li>
<li>I didn't notice that bots too were getting listed. Good find, will fix it, thanks!</li>
<li>I agree with all the feedback on tooltip UI. Rather than spending a lot of effort on styling the tooltip, which we might perhaps want to change to a modal later, for day vs night modes, I think it would be a good idea to work in the modal direction discussed at <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="101" href="/#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/read-receipts.20UI">#design &gt; read-receipts UI</a>. Please see the screenshots there. With that, on hovering the icon we show a simple list of limited size ending with <code>more...</code> and clicking the icon gives a scrollable list in a modal</li>

<p>I think having a single checkmark icon, where if you hover over it, would reveal the list of people who have read the message, would not be that intrusive. It can be located to the right of the message content.</p>

<p>I think this is the kind of feature that users primarily discover when first exploring the app -- that's a time when one might read the items in the message actions menu. </p>
<p>For existing Zulip users, I expect we'll talk about the feature in our next Zulip Cloud newsletter and the 6.0 release announcement as a way for them to discover it. We've talked about advertising new features in-app, and that's probably the best solution for this general class of issue in the future.</p>

<p>Yeah, let's chat.

<p>Have you seen the way skype shows read receipts? Having used it for a few years I find it quite intuitive. A very downscaled image of the users profile pic on the bottom right of the text shows how far down the other users have read the chat. Provides an unobtrusive UX at a glance.</p>

<p>That's certainly an option from a UI standpoint but it's a lot of engineering to ship that data around -- fundamentally a major scaling problem to continuously "show every user how many other users have seen what they're looking at".</p>

<p>Makes sense. The way Skype does it is it only shows the read receipts when group size is lower than a threshold, more than that they just disappear (you can’t see it anymore). To be honest i think it is also most useful in small groups, even just 1-1 conversations, in larger groups it’s more akin to a popularity contest than actual who has seen it kind of information, so this choice makes sense.</p>

<p>For us this feature is reallly important. I understand that it's not possible to find a solution for a large number of users, but it's unfair for little groups :)  in our case its really useful. We do support to customers, often we work in different places and many times we have urgent things to manage , so when I write something important and urgent I need to understand if everyone is reading me or not. If not I have to call them, if they are reading it means they will read my next messages. </p>
<p>This features could be achieved showing the initials of the first 5 or 10 users. I dont see any problem to have this feature and limit it to x users.<br>
If not enough space It could be also a  V icon  per user, and if you mouse hover the V, you see the name of the user who read it</p>
<p>Hope that this feature will arrive !</p>

<p>Does the "Read receipts" dialog automatically update at some interval? If not, adding that along with your solution seems like it should address the occasional desire to closely monitor participation in a conversation.</p>

<p>For the keyboard shortcut idea, the question (as usual) is which key we'd want to use. <code>R</code> and <code>SHIFT + R</code>, which might be natural for "Read receipts", are already in use.</p>
