<p>I know that Zulip has awesome customized fields for profiles, but I don't know the way those fields could be searchable.<br>
For example in Slack you can search on titles of people, is there such thing in Zulip? Is it planned?</p>

<p>It's not currently searchable but it'd be very doable in the "Settings &gt; Users" table from an engineering standpoint. Most of the work would be figuring out how to do the search UI for it.</p>

<p>But who have access to Setting Users? I’m talking about the way to provide user search for all the people who can open another user profile</p>

<p>Everyone has access to that page, though only admins can make edits to user profiles from that page. Here's the link for the page here on CZO: <a href="#organization/user-list-admin">https://chat.zulip.org/#organization/user-list-admin</a>.</p>
