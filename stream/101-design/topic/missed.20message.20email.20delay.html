<p>I'm really excited about <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19119">#19119</a> by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="16839">@Abhijeet Bodas</span>, which rewrites our missed-message email queue worker to use a better data structure, which will allow us to make "How long to wait before sending email notifications for a mention" configurable.  (Currently it is hardcoded to 2 minutes).  </p>
<p>There's a design/semantics question that I'd like to ask that affects exactly how we do this: What should happen with mentions sent during the last few minutes if you change this parameter?</p>

<p>The first option is that any messages you had already received at the moment you make that change have the old setting applied, and any new messages you receive after the change have the new setting applied.</p>

<p>The second option is that we apply the new setting to any potential missed-message emails that have not yet been sent (I.e. if you had previously configured 30 minutes and change it to 10, a mention that had been been tracked since 20 minutes ago would immediately email you).</p>

<p>Basically, which option we pick determines how we store the data.  I think I prefer the second option, since structurally it is applying your settings change more immediately.</p>

<p>That is an…let’s go with “unusual”…database schema, especially in the light of the way it gets updated, which uses quadratic time and database garbage. Is there a reason for this choice?</p>

<p>I think how to story the list of events is a good (separate) question; maybe we should take that to <a class="stream" data-stream-id="3" href="/#narrow/stream/3-backend">#backend</a>?  I think for this audience I mostly want to answer the above UX question.</p>

<p>Continuing this here. Do I understand the question correctly as the following...?</p>
<ul>
<li>If Alice sends Bob a PM at 10:30 AM</li>
<li>and mentions Bob <strong>twice</strong> in a stream #Denmark at 11 AM and 11:05 AM</li>
<li>and if Bob has set his email notifications timer to be 1 hour,</li>
</ul>
<p>how do we want Bob to receive emails?</p>
<ol>
<li>A single email at 11 AM for "Alice mentioned you in #Denmark and PMed you"</li>
<li>
<p>Two emails-</p>
<ul>
<li>One email at 11:30 AM (10:30 AM + 1 hour) for the PM ("Alice PMed you")</li>
<li>and another at 12 noon (11 AM + 1 hour) for both the mentions ("Alice mentioned you twice in #Denmark").</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>seems more like digest emails but for active users, so I would lean towards 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>But 2. might feel spammy, and give rise to frustrations like "I have my settings to send me at most one email every ___ minutes/hours/days, but even then I get so many emails" if we don't word it correctly in the settings page/user docs.</p>

<p>I think we're going to send 2 emails in any case -- our email designs rightly don't try to mix content from unrelated threads (We let you reply from your email client, and that means your email client has to know what thread it is).</p>
<p>So the design question here is whether Bob gets both emails at 11:30AM or one at 11:30AM (for the PM) and one at noon (for the stream notice).</p>

<p>Oh! I didn't know that, thanks. I think then the later makes more sense to me, since the intent behind batching is preventing multiple messages sent consecutively <strong>in a thread</strong> not generate a bunch of emails? Sending all emails together (for cross-thread messages) seems unnecessary in that case.</p>

<p>That's what we have implemented right now, right?  I think it's OK to preserve that model and add the setting and then we can think about whether it's worth changing the model; I'm pretty sure those two changes should mostly commute.</p>
