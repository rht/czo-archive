<p>So this is in reference to <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/6971" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/6971">#6971</a>.</p>
<p>The idea is to return back the cursor (in case it is in a typing position in any input field) to its original position when a link is clicked on the page. Currently, it returns back only to the compose, wherever you might previously be. </p>
<p>So, we'd like to have some suggestions on whether to keep it all throughout the UI  of the chat, or only when the compose box is open (follow <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/6971" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/6971">#6971</a> to get a gist of the discussion in detail). we probably want this in the 3 search UIs on the main page, but we'd like some user feedback on it before proceeding.</p>

<p>I don't think I totally follow -- is this about blurring (un-focusing) a focused text box, or focusing one?</p>

<p>Playing around a bit with our current behavior, as deployed on this server: if I have the compose box open and the message-text box focused, or I have the search box focused, then if I go click on some other topic in the sidebar, I get no text-box focused (and instead the focus is on the message list, I think.) Also the compose box gets closed, if it was open.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-email="greg@zulipchat.com" data-user-id="2187">@Greg Price</span> this is specifically about when you have compose open and click a link in the message feed.  By default, in a browser, clicking a link like that moves the browser focus (cursor) to that link, so you'd lose your place in the compose box if you wanted to keep typing.</p>

<p>The behavior for clicking links in the UI is not part of the question; the question is more about whether we want to do the same thing for the other text boxes in the app (search users/search at the top, etc.)</p>

<p>Got it, thanks.</p>
<p>Experimenting just now, if I click one of the <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/6971" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/6971">#6971</a> links above while composing a message, when I come back to this tab (since the link opens in a new one) my cursor is right where I left it. But if I do the same while typing in search, it isn't. So I think I understand the context now.</p>

<p>I definitely want this change for the search box, to be like compose. Also the stream and topic boxes in compose, if they don't have it already. Probably the left and right sidebar search boxes.</p>
<p>Thinking, the other text boxes that come to mind are miscellaneous things in settings. ... I think I probably want this fix for all of those. Certainly for any paragraph-sized text boxes (there are a few), where I might go off and look something else and come back. I'm not really thinking of counterexamples where I <em>don't</em> want it.</p>

<p>I guess the tradeoff here is that if you look at <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/6971/files" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/6971/files">https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/6971/files</a>, you'll see that the approaches available for doing this are somewhat messy, and may create (1) perf problems or (2) weird bugs.</p>

<p>Basically, the algorithm is this: when you focus a text area, we can record what text area was focused, and if you focus something else, we can clear that state, and if you click on a link, we can send the focus back to the "previously focused" text area.</p>

<p>(You can't directly just cause the browser to not adjust focus when you click the link, as best I can tell)</p>

<p>I see, so we might want to be choosy about doing it.</p>
<p>I think the one place I've actually wanted this (other than message compose) is the search box. Anything in settings isn't super likely just because there aren't so many links there.</p>
