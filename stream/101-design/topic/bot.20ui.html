<p>Since I have been creating and modify a lot of bot users lately, I thought it would be helpful to give a little feedback:</p>

<p>The video's a little under ten minutes.  I didn't spot any outright bugs, but there are lots of little details that can be improved.</p>

<p>The timing for this is less than perfect with Alya about to go on maternity leave.  On the other hand, I feel like most of my complaints here are fairly straightforward, so that if a summer student wanted to improve this, they could just kinda make decisions on their own and submit a PR.</p>

<p>If nothing else, I think it would be useful for somebody with about 20 minutes of free time to watch the video and see if any of my feedback resonates with you, just to increase the tribal knowledge.</p>

<p>This interface hasn't really gotten much love in the last several years, since people understandably focus design effort on other parts of the app.  But the good part of that is that I think there's some really low-hanging fruit here.</p>

<p>FWIW I almost never have time to watch videos -- handling the traffic in this community requires a lot of skimming. But I certainly think we need to redo that part of the UI, and I don't have a clear idea for the right direction to take it in.</p>

<p>I think most of the problems that I point out in the video would be pretty obvious to anybody who experiments with the UI.  It's nothing mission critical.  I just think it's a good project for somebody who is kind of interested in bots and has some frontend skills.</p>

<p>I am also happy, of course, to answer any questions if somebody watches the video.  I can also try to summarize some of my points in text format if somebody takes an interest in improving the bot UI.  Like I said, there aren't any actual bugs, but there is a lot of low hanging fruit for simple improvements.</p>

<p>If somebody embarks on this project, the thing that will probably need most of your attention (Tim) is what we should do about bots being identified by email.  That probably requires some sort of backend fix in the long run that is out of the scope of what I am trying to accomplish here and what I described in the video.  But it does come in the video.  I think there there are some easier things to address before we open that can of worms.</p>

<p>I don't have any suggestions right now, however I believe we should ask for password before getting API key, similar to how we fetch API key for a user.</p>
