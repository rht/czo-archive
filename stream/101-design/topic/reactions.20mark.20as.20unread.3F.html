<p>Hey! There's a user problem where sometimes you're waiting for a response on some message (e.g. an approval of some proposal), and there's no good way to notice that you got a response if it comes in the form of an emoji reaction (e.g. a thumbs up).</p>
<p>A possible solution is to mark your own message as unread when it receives a reaction. We could have this be a user setting.</p>
<p>I could also imagine a "watch this message" option (on your messages or anyone else's) that would mark that specific message as unread when someone reacts.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>I like the idea of having a setting with 3 options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never mark messages as unread due to a reaction.</li>
<li>Mark messages you sent as unread when the first other user reacts to it.</li>
<li>Mark messages you sent as unread whenever another user reacts to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>And I'd imagine the middle one would be the default.</p>
