<p>We received a user request for temporarily pausing desktop notifications, e.g. turning them off for 30 minutes at the start of a meeting. I'm wondering what folks think about where we would put this feature.</p>
<p>Looking at other apps, perhaps it belongs on the user card, alongside status/availability options, and in the personal menu once we have one (<a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/22802">#22802</a>)? </p>

<p>This feels like something that belongs more at an OS configuration level? For example, if I were to run not just Zulip but plenty of other apps, should I expect them to all have this feature, and if they did, should I go through each one at the start of a meeting?</p>
<p>I'm not sure what exists in Linux and Mac for comparison, but does eg. Focus Assist on Windows achieve something comparable?</p>

<p>I agree it ideally would be an OS-level thing. If there are good OS features for this, doing our own documentation for those would likely be a good idea.</p>

<p>Probably doing something ourselves is going to be the most reasonable option though.</p>
