<p>It feels like the customizability of the color perhaps needs to be more discoverable?</p>

<p>Maybe? It's not actually a thing you want to do often when there hasn't just been a design change, so I wouldn't want to make it <em>too</em> prominent. It's already available in 2 places (stream three-dot menu in the left sidebar, and stream settings).</p>

<p>Our approach to stream colors may change when we introduce stream groups, since we'll probably want to offer a stream group color configuration.</p>

<p>I was having the same thought as Alex -- we have it in a few places where we do stream settings, but folks clearly don't know you can change them; I don't think this is the first time we've seen folks learn you can change them only by talking to someone who works on Zulip. </p>
<p>I could imagine putting a color-change icon in stream recipient bars; that might prove to be much more discoverable than the places we have it now.  (Or I could imagine clicking on the globe icon being a way to change it without new icons, but that feels like the kind of thing that's also possibly not very discoverable)</p>

<p>the UI is also a bit weird -- it seems to swap between HSL and RGB, and "confirm" gives no feedback other than sometimes swapping between the two?<br>

<p>Yeah, I was meaning to check up on that -- thanks for bumping the PR thread.</p>
