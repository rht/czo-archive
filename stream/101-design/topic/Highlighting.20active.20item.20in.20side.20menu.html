<p>I was working on <a href="#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/UI.20redesign.3A.20left.20sidebar">sidebar</a> and realized that I don't think that Slack approach of showing active section outside folded group is a great feature.<br>
We are trying to do the same thing </p>
<p><a href="/user_uploads/2/14/D4nN4V8qwbBTNpwvcxWky_xj/image.png">image.png</a><br>
but when I scroll down... we don't <br>
<a href="/user_uploads/2/b0/_mAuus8h6WxJB2yWzmdDIyIR/image.png">image.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/14/D4nN4V8qwbBTNpwvcxWky_xj/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/14/D4nN4V8qwbBTNpwvcxWky_xj/image.png"></a></div><div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/b0/_mAuus8h6WxJB2yWzmdDIyIR/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/b0/_mAuus8h6WxJB2yWzmdDIyIR/image.png"></a></div><p>So I don't understand why would we show the active item for a user who is looking at the main screen.<br>
I suggest we don't do this at all. Partly because it is hard to implement correctly in all cases... but well that is just code.<br>
I don't think Slack or Zulip does it correctly anyway. It is like 50/50 chances that you will see currently active item in the side bar and this is just not relishable. </p>
<p>Good navigation should show where you at in the context of some hierarchy not just "you are where you are".<br>
So I think instead we should highlight folded parent group as selected but don't show selected item outside such group.</p>
<p>You are talking to Vlad and folded DMs? Ok let us highlight that you are in DMs<br>
You are in topic X but folded the whole stream group? Ok let us highlight that you are in this stream group. And if you over scrolled that folded group in the left side bar we don't show you anything.. we could later make a little line stick to top or bottom like apple calendar does.</p>
<p>If we want a feature which will navigate, expand and highlight exact location of a menu item inside the menu we should do that feature and it could initially be behind more button of the recipient bar. Later we could make a click to currently active view header to do that.</p>

<p>We've already implemented it basically correctly, so I don't think complexity/difficulty is a major argument on that detail. </p>
<p>I find it useful that I can scroll around the left sidebar and find where I am, and that you get a row that looks like the row would look like if the region were expanded (and with the ability to immediately access the little <code>\vdots</code> menu for it).</p>
<p>But maybe I'm missing the concern -- is the issue that with Direct Messages, we can show you where you are with a single line nicely, but in a stream/topic pair, we'd have to display both the current stream and the topic inside a collapsed stream group?</p>

<p>That does feel a bit weird; obviously it's only a concern if we have collapsable stream groups in the sidebar at all.</p>
<p>There may be options that feel nice ... I think the best in my mind would be just having the entire currently active stream (with its topics) be visible even in a collapsed stream group... it's not going to be super common to navigate into such a situation, and I think it'd feel pretty intuitive what's going on if you get into it?</p>

<p>Let's clarify "correctly".<br>
I select a user in DM:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/2/a2/cVKIc1d6NEasO-4Sfuzwoelc/image.png">image.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/a2/cVKIc1d6NEasO-4Sfuzwoelc/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/a2/cVKIc1d6NEasO-4Sfuzwoelc/image.png"></a></div><p>I scroll down, I don't see my selection:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/2/f0/N4SvOAsdWmOt2UpoQSSgddIv/image.png">image.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/f0/N4SvOAsdWmOt2UpoQSSgddIv/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/f0/N4SvOAsdWmOt2UpoQSSgddIv/image.png"></a></div><p>I scroll down further, so DMs are folded and don't see my selection:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/2/56/W4OvfcV7l5zTLp1FO76xb8Nf/image.png">image.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/56/W4OvfcV7l5zTLp1FO76xb8Nf/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/56/W4OvfcV7l5zTLp1FO76xb8Nf/image.png"></a></div><p>How come?</p>
<p>But when I scroll up and know exactly where I am..<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/2/f3/mL8G5UkBmH5AD5iz680MMAnq/image.png">image.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/f3/mL8G5UkBmH5AD5iz680MMAnq/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/f3/mL8G5UkBmH5AD5iz680MMAnq/image.png"></a></div><p>I fold DMs, maybe I don't want a person next to me see the list of people I'm talking to:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/2/5a/bK_alSgRx4yfcezu_bQYk8hw/image.png">image.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/5a/bK_alSgRx4yfcezu_bQYk8hw/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/5a/bK_alSgRx4yfcezu_bQYk8hw/image.png"></a></div><p>And now I have a clear highlight... what for? 3 dots menu and status of a user? We should have 3 dot menu and status in the title of the conversation here <br>
<a href="/user_uploads/2/67/C8VEB9DJtqBX-zPbpval7IPR/image.png">image.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/67/C8VEB9DJtqBX-zPbpval7IPR/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/67/C8VEB9DJtqBX-zPbpval7IPR/image.png"></a></div><p>I think we already agreed on 3 dots in <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="101" href="/#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/Follow.20Topics.20UI">#design &gt; Follow Topics UI</a> : <br>
<a href="/user_uploads/2/6d/G9gS15Jg8pr5VdJ3rieU1kKu/image.png">image.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/6d/G9gS15Jg8pr5VdJ3rieU1kKu/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/6d/G9gS15Jg8pr5VdJ3rieU1kKu/image.png"></a></div><p>In anyway that active selection in the left sidebar doesn't stay for long because as soon as I scroll down I don't see it:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/2/26/OS1o73ih3YTWT5o-4LVFQLR5/image.png">image.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/26/OS1o73ih3YTWT5o-4LVFQLR5/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/26/OS1o73ih3YTWT5o-4LVFQLR5/image.png"></a></div><p>What is the reason to hide it? Is it not a correct implementation?<br>
Is it a way to have DMs always collapsed and see with home I'm talking? But I see that from the middle message column and should be able to perform all the actions related to that conversation right from the conversation.</p>
<p>Anyway, what is desired behavior in the new side panel? To always show in a sticky (If it isn't sticky I don't understand why would we need it at all) way active selection under Views and DMs?<br>
Ignoring this case for Streams?</p>

<p>I'm not sure what I think here. Personally I don't have a problem with the highlighted current item being possible to scroll offscreen; you have to have done the scroll yourself to arrange that, so it's not a surprise to the user. </p>
<p>Whereas having it not be visible at all because it's in a collapsed section feels a lot more like a state users would find confusing and potentially spend significant time trying to find where their currently selected option is in the sidebar.</p>
