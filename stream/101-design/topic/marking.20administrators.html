<p>Would it be useful for Zulip to have some of tag marking organization administrators (one could imagine something similar to the bot logo we have next to bots, or maybe something in the profile popovers)?</p>

<p>I think there is some downside risk of potentially supporting "these people are in charge" type dynamics, but I think for many communities, it could be helpful for people to be able to see if someone who is responsible for the community is around.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-email="tabbott@zulipchat.com" data-user-id="7">@Tim Abbott</span> I'm not sure about the bot marker.

<p>There probably are some scenarios where organizations don't want to publicly list who the admins are, but I think we can cross that bridge when we get to it.  I personally think we should only list them in the settings UI.  I think it can be somewhat distracting and occasionally politically delicate to show admins in the main UI.</p>

<p>For larger realms that may have multiple admins, I think we may want to think about an <code>admin@</code> mechanism to ask for help, where <code>admin@</code> works like a group PM on the back end, or maybe does something more out-of-band.</p>

<p>When I am evaluating whether I want to get more involved in a community, one quick check I make sometimes is "are there any admins who are women?" So I do want some way to discover who the admins are. But this also ties into a larger feature, which is the ability for administrators to make easily available some kind of metadata about the org -- what the community norms are, who to contact in case of xyz, streams you should stay subscribed to even if you mute them, and similar guidance.</p>

<p>I think the problem with that check is that "administrators" can mean different things to different orgs; the actual people running the org may not be the IT admins</p>

<p>Doing at least one of these seems like a good idea. (Semi-routinely in my other zulip, people will want to know how to remove folks from private streams. It'd be nice to be able to easily tell them who they can ask, without depending on my memory. Also the private stream ownership thing would be nice to fix, but presumably there will be other admin-only actions regardless.)</p>

<p>On the "what is an admin, exactly" idea, there could be different categories of "administrator." Ravelry does this, where some users have what is effectively a special tag in their user profile that identifies membership in a group. Volunteer editors have one, staff has another, most users have none.</p>

<p>Let's open an issue for the formatting quirk.  I think there is good reason for a single blank line to not break a quote-block in markdown, but probably it doesn't make sense for several blank lines to not break it up...</p>
