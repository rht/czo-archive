<p>After reviewing <a href="#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/UI.20redesign/near/1343706">the current redesign draft</a>, I have a few comments on the rendering of message internals:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the bullet indentation is a few pixels too far to the left.  It looks like it's going a bit into the gutter below the avatar, which I think looks off and will also potentially collide with the "EDITED" indicator that uses that space.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>I am not a fan of the light grey font color for bullets and numbered lists. I think my reasoning is that the numbering is that we generally use grey colors for components that we expect the user to visually filter out / ignore, and I think the bullets (or numbering) in a message is conceptually first-class information in the message that one wants to read (And to the extent that numbered lists are used, it's usually with intent to use the numbering in discussion, e.g. someone might say "Regarding point 2, ...").</li>

<ul>
<li>In general I like the idea of the emoji images inside emoji reactions being a bit bigger, since it's an important part of being able to parse what they are. But I'm not sure about having a large amount of space around the emoji image; it feels a bit off to me for the emoji reaction element to have greater height than the line of text in a one-line message, and I think that's the case in this design?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>I notice that there's increased line spacing between different messages by the same sender. Is there a similarly increased spacing between paragraph in a single multi-paragraph message? We have in the past had the goal of having those two vertical spacings be essentially identical, because it reduces stress when sending a long series of thoughts -- you can split up a long series of thoughts into multiple messages or do them as a single message and both will look visually nice to users. For context, there was a while when we observed users doing all sorts of message editing workarounds (E.g. copying content from follow-up messages into extra paragraphs in the first one and then deleting the now duplicate second message) in order to get reasonable paragraph spacing in a chain posting. </p>
<p><a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="6" href="/#narrow/stream/6-frontend/topic/recipient.20row.20livestream">#frontend &gt; recipient row livestream</a> is a good example of the type of content where one has a nice reading experience that benefits from follow-up messages being the same height as paragraph breaks.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><code>Inline code blocks</code> appear to have a grey background in the screenshots. I'm not sure whether this is intentional or just a detail that hasn't been specifically adjusted from the default, but I think they look a lot nicer with the white/black backgrounds we have today.</li>
</ul>

Technically its is in the text rectangle. I visually overcompensated the circle:<br>

Yes.</p>

<p>Depends on a person. I don't think of them as first-class information, since it is additional visual ordering. I don't read in my mind <code>circle Regular text</code> or <code>number one Regular text</code>.</p>
<p>Dots of the same as text color look too heavy, while numbers of the same color are less distinctive actually (lost in text):<br>

If we want same as text emoji we have to give up the pill around them otherwise emoji would be too small:<br>

<p>I made them big to make easy to click on them. I thought it is appropriate for the emotional reaction be bigger than the text.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The whole suggested structure of highlights and selection box prevents from having that. <br>
And I didn't know about such goal. Is it still the goal? <br>
Why should we fake it with visual design instead of actually solving it? If there is desire to stick message to the previous, let's just attach it and update the time?<br>
We discussed vertical spacing with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="19257">@Alya Abbott</span> and I spend significant time to incorporate it inside the message.<br>
I need to think about this. I understand the argument and now want Zulip to give me the ability to select everything per paragraph (and I don't care how the message was written originally)</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Probably but I always have a hard time to find them and wanted to make them more distinctive. In another thread I made an example with a lighter bg.</p>

<p>Just another point of the feedback... <code>Edited</code> label is not the most important information and I shouldn't read it first.<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/2/c6/U3_wuDbSGHFjilqD-f1HKRiF/image.png">image.png</a>. In the majority of times I don't care. It could easily be hidden inside the time label with * symbol: <strong>16:16</strong>*</p>

<p>Mm, yeah, I wasn't aware of the history / intent with message spacing. Maybe we can talk about the options on a call.</p>
