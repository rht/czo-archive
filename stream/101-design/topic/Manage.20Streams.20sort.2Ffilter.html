<p>The current behavior for Manage Streams is wonky when it comes to combing a filter and sort.  Suppose you use "dev" as the filter.  It will show all streams whose names match "dev" above all streams whose description matches "dev".  And then even if you sort by weekly traffic, the name-match streams will stay above the description-match streams.</p>
<p>I think this might be an accident of the original implementation, but I'm not sure.</p>
<p>I find the current behavior to be less than ideal.  If nothing else, we should have some kind of visual distinction between the streams that match on name vs. those that match on description.   Otherwise, users are likely to just think our sorts are broken.  Or, worse, they might not even realize that high-traffic streams are below the fold.</p>
<p>Fortunately, most times that you apply a filter, you get pretty close to being able to fit all streams on the screen.</p>
<p>But it would be nice to re-visit this.</p>

<p>This certainly seems like a bug -- when you sort by weekly traffic, that should be the first sort key before anything else.  I'm not sure that the prioritization of name over description in sorting is wrong, though-- certainly I'm more interested in name matches than description matches, but want to see both categories.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="7">@Tim Abbott</span> I think we just need a product decision here.  Here are the choices for the sort keys:</p>
<ul>
<li>(name-in-filter: bool, weekly_traffic: int) -- this is what we have now and seems clearly broken</li>
<li>(weekly_traffic: int)  -- just keep it simple</li>
<li>(weekly_traffic: int, name: str)</li>
<li>(weekly_traffic: int, name-in-filter: bool, name: str) </li>
</ul>
<p>I'm inclined to the simple approach here, as I don't think tiebreakers come up much.</p>

<p>I don't think I understand your notation for the options; can you explain them again?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="7">@Tim Abbott</span> <code>(name-in-filter: bool, weekly_traffic: int)</code> means that the first "key" we check is whether the name is in the filter.  So a "true" match always go ahead of a "false" match.  And then the second key (tiebreaker) is the weekly traffic count.</p>

<p>The simplest thing to do here is to just sort by weekly traffic.</p>

<p>Sorting by weekly traffic if the user selected that makes sense; but don't we only display at all streams with names matching the filter, making the ordering of these operations irrelevant?</p>

<p>I guess the point is if it's a weaker match on the filter (e.g. because the stream description, rather than the name matches)?  </p>
<p>I think just sorting by weekly traffic if the user has selected that is probably fine.</p>

<p>Yes, that's exactly why we have the current behavior that just looks buggy.</p>

<p>Good, I'll go with that.  (and similar for subscription counts)</p>
