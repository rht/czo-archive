<p>Continuing a discussion from <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/5328" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/5328">#5328</a> here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think date changes are more important than timestamps, and you basically always want to know when 3 days passed in between two parts of a conversation, since that almost always has a significant impact on the meaning of the discussion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think 90% of the time though, the date change will be the midnight one.<br>
I guess I imagine two different scenarios in which one copies messages:</p>
<ul>
<li>to copy it to someone not in the stream as an fyi (or e.g. someone joined a private stream too late, and didn't get the original messages), where the exact details don't really matter</li>
<li>a more legalistic or operational situation where the timing matters a lot</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first case, I think having it as uncluttered as possible is best. <br>
That being said, I don't feel strongly about this, and it's not a situation that comes up often. If we do keep it, putting it in parens, like <code>Denmark &gt; Denmark1 (Yesterday)</code> instead of <code>Denmark &gt; Denmark1 Yesterday</code> would also help.</p>

<p>I think the solution to the midnight issue is probably to just special case a midnight where the messages on either side are within an hour.</p>
