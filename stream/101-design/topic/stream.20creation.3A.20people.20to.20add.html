<p>Trying to rethink the "People to add" section of our stream creation flow, since it is a mess.<br>
What would folks think of just an input box, where you could enter in streams or users with a combined typeahead?</p>
<p>E.g. something like the last input box of <br>
<a href="/user_uploads/2/77/R0UNaUoQEkIxi2NnbDq7yCuU/pasted_image.png" target="_blank" title="pasted_image.png">pasted image</a></p>

<p>If I'm adding 10 people to a stream, and I'm kind of doing it from memory or looking around the room, I think it's useful to see the people I've added so far.  (The painful part of our current UI is that you see the 990 people you haven't added.)</p>

<p>oh yeah, I'm imagining pills for the streams and people you add, similar to the picture in the 11:08 message.<br>
The thing that is lost is being able to add a small stream, and see right there who exactly was added.</p>
<p>(along with wonderful features like being able to add the set difference of streams, including by accident)</p>

<p>Another option is that when you select a stream, just put the pills for all the stream users into the textbox.  (or have a way to "explode" a pill into individual users)</p>

<p>My intuition is that it is at most it a lightly used feature. Even when that was explicitly my goal (create a copy of a stream minus someone), the current UI for doing it doesn't make it clear that that is going to happen, so I end up adding people by hand.</p>

<p>Yeah, but our realm is huge...for a ~50 person realm, I think the mechanism would have been a bit more clear.  I'm fine with regressing this, but we should be prepared to scramble a bit if we release this and folks complain.</p>
