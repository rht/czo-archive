<p>We recently got a user request for a keyboard shortcut for starred messages, which seems reasonable if we can figure out what key we want to use.</p>
<p>Currently, <code>Ctrl+S</code> stars a message; <code>S</code> is used for navigation. <code>Shift+S</code> is available (it was previously used for navigation). <code>*</code> is also unused; I think we may have discussed that one in connection with starred messages before.</p>

<p>In my opinion <code>*</code> seems better to me semantically but I think <code>Shift + S</code> might be more user-friendly?</p>

<p>Honest question: has there ever been discussion of sequential keyboard shortcuts in Zulip? For example, in Gmail the sequence <code>g i</code> goes to the Inbox, <code>g s</code> goes to starred messages, etc.</p>

<p>I almost sure this has been suggested.  I would certainly use them.  The <code>g</code> thing is also used in vim. (<code>g f</code> to go to a file)</p>

<p>The trouble with <code>g</code> of course is that it currently opens the gear menu...</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure <code>g</code> opens the gear menu precisely because we had like <code>g s</code> as a keyboard sequence to take you to settings very early on, with a vision that <code>g {key}</code> sequences would be used for navigating that menu.</p>

<p>I think multi key sequences where the first key doesn't do something are a bad idea to introduce -- they generally create an invisible modality to the UI that I think isn't going to feel good. (I know <code>vim</code> has a bunch of multi key sequences, but they also have a place in the UI where they show the state of where you are in such a sequence, and I think that's important).</p>
<p>A keyboard shortcut for this is probably a good idea. I would propose something like <code>Ctrl+Shift+S</code>.</p>

</ul>
<p>As per those topics and discussions above, there seems no obvious key for starred or mentions narrows - at least if one assumes <code>@</code> and <code>*</code>/<code>ctrl</code>+<code>s</code> were already taken as the keys to add messages to those narrows. The multi-key option was certainly preferred at one point, but later conversations perhaps point to single keys - though eg <code>m</code> has been subsequently picked for 'move' in the web app.</p>
<p>Those discussions above are worth reading, though it's unclear if they views expressed there are still accurate :)</p>

<p>Some of those discussions involve Zulip-terminal, where the left and right panels have always been keyboard-navigable (left/right or vim-equivalent). However, given our keyboard focus, we also moved to add shortcut/hot keys for all the top-left buttons that it directly supports. Without that, while out of compose one can always enter the left panel with one (or two) direction keys, but need to adjust focus to a given narrowing button, from what was potentially much further down in the left panel.</p>
<p>Given an ongoing absence of keys in the web app to synchronize with, Zulip-terminal settled on (see <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip-terminal#intentional-differences">https://github.com/zulip/zulip-terminal#intentional-differences</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Mentions [<code>#</code>]</li>
<li>Starred messages [<code>f</code>] (~ messages you are 'following')</li>
</ul>
<p>ZT could certainly aim to support alternatives if the web app chose them. Within ZT, a key to effectively focus the top-left (like <code>g</code>) and use a scroll/hotkey there to select a narrowing button could be more direct than moving left and scrolling up from what could be somewhere much lower in the stream or topic list. However, I'd prefer single keys like we currently have, not only a sequence (<code>g &lt;key&gt;</code>). The reason for this is that narrowing in ZT is treated as maintaining message context (if possible), and I feel the fluidity of that could be lost if the focus jumps, when a single key is available.</p>

<p>For getting to "Starred messages" what I really want is natural keyboard navigation.  Give me some way to get to the left sidebar navigation panel, and then let me tab down to it.  Because I am an advanced user, I have been able to internalize a bunch of hotkeys, but I really just want natural navigation so that I don't have to guess or memorize anything.  (I realize this a bit of an aside, but it is relevant.)</p>
