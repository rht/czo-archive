<p>When a new stream is created, its only topic is initially "stream events". As a result, I've seen users accidentally post to "stream events", which is awkward.</p>
<p>Since we are working on setting up a default "general topic" folks can use if they don't want to specify a topic, it would be good if any initial stream messages where the user isn't paying attention went to "general topic", not "stream events". The easies way to do that would probably be to send an automated message (e.g., from Notification Bot) to that topic, introducing the topic and/or stream.</p>
<p>What do folks think? We could also send a message there <em>instead of</em> "stream events", but it seems nice to have a full record of the stream's history in the "stream events" thread.</p>

<p>This might seem like a minor edge case, but because it's something users will encounter the most early on in the organizations's Zulip experience, I think it's worth worrying about.</p>

<p>I think having "stream events" have the stream's history of changes does feel like a helpful pattern.</p>

<p>So I think probably sending a message to "general chat" would be the best way to initialize that space in a newly created stream. </p>
<p>(I thought we'd decided to use "general chat", not "general topic"?)</p>

<p>You should catch up on <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="101" href="/#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/UI.20redesign.3A.20compose.20box">#design &gt; UI redesign: compose box</a> ;)</p>

<p>I guess we need to decide what the message would be, and who the sender is. Maybe something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://zulip.com/help/starting-a-new-topic">Starting a new topic</a> for each conversation helps keep your messages <a href="https://zulip.com/help/streams-and-topics">organized</a>. However, you can always send messages here to chat without naming a topic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I'm not sure if it's more appropriate for Notification Bot to send this, or Welcome Bot (or if there are other options?).</p>

<p>Those are the only two bots who might be appropriate. We at some point had like 5 of these, but collapsed everything but the onboarding messages into Notification Bot like 4 years ago.</p>

<p>What if we just didn't post that first event anywhere? It's usually clear that the stream being created was the first event. Is it because we want to show who made it?</p>

<p>Yeah, it seems helpful to have a record of who created it and when.</p>
