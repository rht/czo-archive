<p>Hi,<br>
My name is Hayder I have been using Zulip for the past two weeks in our company we think there's something in the design that will help a lot if implemented.<br>
Which is having messages sent aligned to the right and messages received aligned to the right just like it's in most Chat apps.<br>
It will greatly help in reading the messages specially when reading from history</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="15718">@Hayder Sinan</span> This style is definitely common, and I'm sure others will respond too, but personally I'm not sure if this left/right styling will work so well for Zulip. Many other systems are based on writing shorter messages to get a reply in quickly since messages aren't limited to specific topics; since Zulip has less of an issue with this then message lengths can be naturally longer.</p>

<p>About long messages I don't think it will be an issue with alignment if we added a limited width that a message can take for example only 90% of available width and in this way both the message will take enough space and the alignment will give a much better in identifying the sender of the message if it's me or not</p>

<p>It's an interesting idea... the central theme being: "Visually differentiate me (and my messages) from them."<br>
Our competitors don't do this, probably because it doesn't make sense / look good / cause convenient eye movement and UX.<br>
Maybe prototype with having one's own username to the right? idk.<br>
Maybe give your own messages a different colored background?</p>
<p>Maybe this is a change we only want to do for PMs? Those are more likely to be 1 to 1 conversations. but then... that'd make PMs look different from regular stream conversations. Which might be something we want anyway, idk!</p>
<p>When you're talking to 5 or six people at a time, which is what this and our competitors products are designed to facilitate, how often does it matter to identify your own name?</p>
<p>Very interesting idea, thanks for bringing it up. </p>
<p>I'd love to see mock ups.<br>
(You can make them in MS paint or photoshop for all I care, I'd really just like to see some of the ideas here).</p>

<p>Which is why a lot in my company has suggested to me that we implement some way of a threading in PMs as well not to go with topics but at least grouping messages togather somehow. Since a lot of them time we talk in 1 to 1 about 2 or 3 different things at the same time so with simple would much more organized but that discussion for a different topic</p>

<p>but anyway, another benefit of using a private stream to handle such discussions is that you have control over the history of the conversation. If necessary, you can invite other people into the conversation and share the history with them. This is something that you can not do via PMs.</p>

<p>Hi<br>
Well it's very to control 800 users who will they talk but even if we went with private streams it will be hell since if we went with we will endwith a lot of streams which basically it works just like a PM<br>
We already have a log of private streams.</p>

<p>And topics talk about in PM most of the time have a short period of couple of minutes which will be annoying to manage this in stream also it will most of the rime like 99% there's need to share it's history with others.</p>

<p>I have thought of doing some testing so I have tries the two big names <code>Slack</code> and <code>MS Teams</code> Slack is already being used by some teams in our enterprise which we looking to migrate their work to <code>Zulip</code> so I tries with them.<br>
my finding was the following </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>MS Teams (as pre the images attached) <code>Quota
 as @**Yash RE ✨**  has suggested Maybe this is a change we only want to do for PMs? Those are more likely to be 1 to 1 conversations. but then... that'd make PMs look different from regular stream conversations. Which might be something we want anyway, idk!</code></p>
<ul>
<li>for PM called chat there it has different alignments sender to the write and receiver on the left.</li>
<li>for streams called teams there it has a single alignment everything to the left like in here but the difference is that the messages are encapsulated with in a box which makes very clear boundaries even with replies seems much more clear. </li>
<li>Slack</li>
<li>does it in the same way it's being done in here there are no boundaries all messages no matter where it is has the same alignment. which I also hated</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>also something else worth mentioning I'm not sure if it applies for something I have created two poll  in our company </p>
<ul>
<li>the first asks about those alignment and I have added the same photos also added the photos from Zulip and Slack I have got 233 replies so far distributed as follows<ul>
<li>MS Teams: 103</li>
<li>Slack: 63</li>
<li>Zulip: 67</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the second is about overall design of the app and colors contrast<ul>
<li>Light Theme: all three got almost the same result very small difference between them</li>
<li>Dark Theme: for this one Slack came out on top people some how love the colors used by Slack for Dark theme then was MS Teams and then Zulip many has suggested the current dark theme has a little bit bright color so it's not relly dark as compared to Slack or Teams</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope these info helps<br>
Thanks you</p>

<p>Back to the original alignment question, the UI model of right-aligning messages you yourself sent opposite messages other sent works well for a mobile-only chat tool designed for small groups where the screen is small and you send a significant portion of messages, but it's a pretty bad experience in a desktop size browser (where the right-alignment would force one's eyes to scan pretty far away) as well as being the wrong focus for a stream with dozens of users or more (where messages you yourself sent are rare and would just disrupt reading).  This is why all of our peer team chat tools use the same model as Zulip with the same alignment for all messages.</p>
<p>I think there is a possible feature of some sort of visual adornment of messages that you yourself sent to make it easy to visually filter those in PM conversations.</p>
