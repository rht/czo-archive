<p>I see, sorry I missed that. Fwiw I find the integration docs to have a bit of a "wall of text" vibe, which makes it hard to follow (not just the Sentry integration docs); but I'm not a designer myself so I don't have any concrete suggestions on that front.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The exact page the user is talking about is <a href="https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/sentry">this</a>. The layout is pretty much similar to other integrations.</p>
<p>I think the layout looks fine -- maybe that's how the docs are. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="22433">@Vlad Korobov</span> you got anything to say on this one.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think right now our main focus is not there. So, maybe it's something we can touch upon later.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/25976">https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/25976</a> is the plan for replacing the big ugly text that we have to include in every integration page on how to construct a URL into a wizard. It's long overdue.</p>

<p>I consider that a very high priority but also don't think it makes sense to spend attention on any other aspect of the /integrations design until we've implemented that, because it's going to be so impactful to how the pages look/feel.</p>

<p>I definitely have the same feeling as that user, and I think "wall of text" is a very good way to describe it.</p>

<p>The wizard for constructing the URL will help, but the problem will still be there.</p>
<p>In particular, in this case the piece of text the user (understandably) missed was in a different area of the wall of text: <br>
<a href="/user_uploads/2/8/VNuj3jeow7c7LfB4YPQ8TBm1/image.png">image.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/8/VNuj3jeow7c7LfB4YPQ8TBm1/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/8/VNuj3jeow7c7LfB4YPQ8TBm1/image.png"></a></div><p>I'd even say that that part has the wall-of-text problem worse than the part for constructing the URL does: <br>
<a href="/user_uploads/2/da/WAIFtUwxPPx_glBeVE3hsztB/image.png">image.png</a></p>

<p>I think the biggest factor that makes this a wall of text and difficult to read is that it needs more structure. This paragraph is presented as a single numbered step:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go to your organization's <strong>settings</strong> in Sentry. Then go to <strong>Developer Settings</strong> and click on the <strong>Create New Integration</strong> button, then select <strong>Internal Integration</strong>. There, set the <strong>Webhook URL</strong> to the URL you constructed in the above step then enable <strong>Alert Rule Action</strong>. You can fill out the remaining details as you like. If you want notifications for issues and not just events, you can scroll down to <strong>Webhooks</strong> on the same page and check the box that says <strong>issue</strong>. Make sure that you set up the permissions so that the integration will be visible to the right people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's at least four steps, on a generously coarse counting. Nine steps, on a finer-grained count. It should be broken out in the form of a list, not run together as one paragraph.</p>



<a name="1609427"></a>
<h4><a href="https://chat.zulip.org#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/integration%20docs/near/1609427" class="zl"><img src="https://rht.github.io/czo-archive/assets/img/zulip.svg" alt="view this post on Zulip" style="width:20px;height:20px;"></a> Greg Price <a href="https://rht.github.io/czo-archive/stream/101-design/topic/integration.20docs.html#1609427">(Jul 13 2023 at 19:25)</a>:</h4>
<p>The part this user missed was the paragraph after that. That paragraph starts with "<strong>NOTE:</strong> " but isn't in any other way set off as a note or warning.</p>
<p>In the Help Center I think we've generally gotten pretty good at writing out instructions with appropriate step-by-step structure, and using formatting like "note" boxes to helpfully structure the overall page. The integrations docs are generally in need of applying those same techniques.</p>



<a name="1609430"></a>
<h4><a href="https://chat.zulip.org#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/integration%20docs/near/1609430" class="zl"><img src="https://rht.github.io/czo-archive/assets/img/zulip.svg" alt="view this post on Zulip" style="width:20px;height:20px;"></a> Greg Price <a href="https://rht.github.io/czo-archive/stream/101-design/topic/integration.20docs.html#1609430">(Jul 13 2023 at 19:28)</a>:</h4>
<p>In this case, what's really going on between those two paragraphs is that there are two different approaches the user can take on the Sentry side for setting things up:</p>
<ul>
<li>a "webhook" is simpler to set up but leaves out some events;</li>
<li>an "internal integration" is more complex to set up but more comprehensive.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the way we'd write that in the Help Center would first set the context that there are these two choices with those differences, and then set out instructions for each of them separately.</p>

<p>I didn't break those out into step by step instructions like we do in the help center, as that's not the style used for the integrations docs in general. If we want to move towards that style / structure, then we definitely can.</p>

<p>Ah, neat! Much improved. I think the box highlighting the "Note:" paragraph would be especially likely to have helped the user who had the problem above.</p>

<p>I do think step-by-step instructions would be a helpful format to move to for the integration docs in general.</p>
<p>That sounds like a lot of work, though. Perhaps it'll make sense to batch that as part of the sweep we'll be doing through these docs for the constructing-the-URL steps, to roll out <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/25976">#25976</a>.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, we should definitely run that and possibly also run it on the 7.x branch; right now all our integration screenshots show the 6.x Zulip design.</p>
