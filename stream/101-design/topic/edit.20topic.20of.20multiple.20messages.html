<p>Our team has quickly grown to love (and depend on!) Zulip.  However, one request that comes up often is the ability, on the desktop/web app, to select multiple messages in a topic and bulk re-allocate them to another topic (and/or another stream).</p>
<p>If we understand the Zulip paradigm correctly, then re-allocation of messages between topics is something that should be happening on a not-infrequent basis.  For example, you're having a conversation on one topic but then realise that something that has been said mid-conversation deserves its own topic.  However, at the moment you either have to re-allocate message-by-message - which quickly gets fiddly and repetitious - or you have to re-allocate all messages in the topic (falling either (i) before and after the selected message, or (ii) after the selected message).</p>
<p>The ability to hold down, e.g., the Command key and click-select multiple messages and then re-allocate all of those selected messages with one edit would be very powerful.  Perhaps, in the fullness of time, the ability to simply drag-drop those selected messages onto a new topic could even be introduced.</p>
<p>I've had a search within this <a class="stream" data-stream-id="101" href="/#narrow/stream/101-design">#design</a>  stream, as well as a look at  the official documentation and couldn't find anything pertinent but apologies if this functionality exists but I've missed it.</p>

<p>I think if someone can prototype reasonable "Shift+Click" type frontend UI for selecting a set of messages that folks like, the rest of this feature is pretty straightforward, and it'd certainly be nice to have.</p>

<p>Zulip has Up and Down keyboard message navigation. Would it be easier to start a prototype using "Shift+Up" and "Shift+Down" to leverage the "selectable_row" class in the message table?</p>
