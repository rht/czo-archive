<p>This is a question I'd really like to get feedback from new users on!  </p>
<p>When you make a new Zulip account in an existing organization, we populate your account with a certain amount of history from before you joined.  At present, we add the most recent up to 1000 messages of message history from the last week (which will appear in the "All messages" and "Recent topics" views as well as personal search history), and also mark the most recent 20 as unread, so that you can browse around some unread content.</p>
<p>What do folks think about those parameters (1 week, 1000 total messages, 20 unread)?</p>
<p>(We were reminded of this by <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="43" href="/#narrow/stream/43-automated-testing/topic/Strange.20test.20failure">#automated testing &gt; Strange test failure</a>, just to link the threads).</p>

<p>I think the date constraint isn’t consistent with Zulip’s asynchronous nature.  And limiting recent content to a week can possibly kill off slow starting realms.</p>

<p>I think there's two worldviews on this:</p>
<ul>
<li>We should give you all the content over a certain time period, regardless of quantity.</li>
<li>We should give you a fixed amount of content, regardless of age.</li>
</ul>

<p>In a busy community like this one, I think the worry would be that you show up and see 250 unreads and aren't sure what to do.</p>

<p>In a community that's sending 1 message/day, like a lot of Gitter communities, it might feel a bit weird to get months worth of unread messages on arrival.</p>

<p>I think my proposal is that we should do the 1K messages thing regardless of age (i.e. set you up so that "Recent topics" has a nontrivial amount of data to work with), and then set up to like 100 messages as unread, with that being limited by the last week (less than that gets major weekend effects).</p>

<p>This reminds me of the discussion we had in <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="101" href="/#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/search.20default">#design &gt; search default</a> . The argument for limiting the scope for search was that you'd only be searching messages you've seen by default, but if I'm understanding correctly, search actually also includes 1000 messages you haven't seen?</p>

<p>I think we should keep the number of unreads small, if we are doing any at all. It can be stressful to start out feeling like you are behind already, and I'm not sure there is any advantage to bumping it up.</p>

<p>Well, the advantage is that it makes the left sidebar have some stuff to browse.  At present, you basically need to use "Recent topics" if you're a new user looking to see what conversations are recent in the organization.</p>

<p>I am still mostly against a time constraint.  One week seems way too short for a low-traffic realm.  And high-traffic realms should be constrained by a count.  If we bumped up the one-week limit to one-month, then I think we'd likely avoid the test flake that triggered this situation for 99% of devs.</p>

<p>Newish user here.</p>
<p>As a new user I wouldn't expect to have any unreads when starting out.</p>
<p>I would expect having to find something like "recent topics" to find recently active topics. I don't think that's a negative thing.</p>
<p>I feel like the message history should be zero when starting out as well.</p>
<p>The most prominent negative feeling I remember from getting started in Zulip is feeling overwhelmed and confused. I'm not sure how all this works currently, but getting presented with a huge mixed stream of the latest 1k messages along with several unreads feels like it could have contributed to that.</p>
<p>Having to browse around to find stuff when getting started is not a bad thing in my opinion, it's a natural part of getting used to a program. Getting thrown right into the fray with a lot of stuff going on might not be ideal.</p>

<p>I agree that it's counterintuitive to have any unreads when you've just first signed up, and that having a significant number of them feels likely to sometimes be stressful and overwhelming.</p>

<p>Does this depend on having unreads? I'd think the left sidebar would work fine as long as the client has a decent amount of the history at all.</p>

<p>This question seems also reminiscent of the discussion that started here:<br>
<a href="#narrow/stream/9-issues/topic/.22my.20topics.22.20.3F/near/1230065">https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/9-issues/topic/.22my.20topics.22.20.3F/near/1230065</a></p>
<p>The experience of using Recent Topics is a lot better if the client has a lot of history, and can feel kind of broken when it doesn't. That's true not only of newly-signed-up users, but also -- probably more so -- of people who've been signed up for a while.</p>
<p>Currently the behavior seems to be that if you have any <em>old</em> unreads (even a single unread message, but far enough back in the past), then the client gets plenty of history and you have a good experience. But if you're caught up, the client doesn't get much history and Recent Topics can feel kind of broken. And I guess the same thing is probably true of the left sidebar, if you're trying to use it to browse around.</p>
<p>A new user is naturally fully caught up. It seems like perhaps one thing that's going on here is that the experience of being fully caught up and trying to browse around isn't great. In that case, we should probably have the client fetch more history so that the experience is good.</p>
