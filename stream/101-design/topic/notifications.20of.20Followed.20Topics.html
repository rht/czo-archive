<p>We started a technical discussion around the notification aspect of the "Follow Topics" feature. -- <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="3" href="/#narrow/stream/3-backend/topic/Follow.20Topics">#backend &gt; Follow Topics</a> </p>
<p>We have a product question to discuss:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Should the user be able to configure <strong>email/push/desktop/audible/wildcard_mention</strong> notifications for each followed topic? -- (In parallel to the way we can configure <strong>stream_specfic notifications settings</strong>, as of now).<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/2/20/1K9nUo1vMZ1zsRWTJ2noXsv6/Screenshot-from-2023-05-10-02-08-31.png">stream_specfic settings</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/20/1K9nUo1vMZ1zsRWTJ2noXsv6/Screenshot-from-2023-05-10-02-08-31.png" title="stream_specfic settings"><img src="/user_uploads/2/20/1K9nUo1vMZ1zsRWTJ2noXsv6/Screenshot-from-2023-05-10-02-08-31.png"></a></div></li>
<li>
<p>Or, there should exist a global set of notification settings for "Followed Topics". -- no need for topic_specific settings.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="7">Tim Abbott</span> said:</p>
<p>I think for this bit, what I'd had in mind is that we'd have a global set of settings for "notification policy for topics I follow", rather than that being a <code>UserTopic</code> field.</p>
<p>It would be useful to discuss the product question in <a class="stream" data-stream-id="101" href="/#narrow/stream/101-design">#design</a>, but my thinking is that it'd be excessive complexity to have you feel like you need to do 5 settings for each individual followed topic, and that a single policy for "followed topics", possibly with a per-stream one added in the future, would achieve our goals.</p>

<p>So, I went through the GitHub issues requesting this feature: <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/6027">#6027</a> <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/8754">#8754</a> etc<br>
, and I think <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="7">Tim Abbott</span> 's suggestion makes sense, as I didn't find any comment requesting a per-topic level notification settings for "Followed topics". -- They just want to get notified of the topics they follow.</p>
<p>No granularity in notifications settings like <strong>email-only for one topic and desktop-only for another topic</strong> has been requested.<br>
So, we can skip that for now, and we can always implement that if needed, extending our current technical approach.</p>

<p>I understand how desktop/audible notifications for followed topics might be implemented (if we wanted to), but I'm not sure what's meant by "wildcard mention notifications for followed topics".<br>
Does the proposed setting mean "should wildcard mentions for messages sent in followed topics be treated as personal mentions for the purpose of notifications?"</p>

<p>Adding up the few discussions, we had earlier today:</p>
<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="19257">Alya Abbott</span> said:</p>
<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="7">Tim Abbott</span> and I chatted offline today, and were thinking that the most reasonable approach would be to have all these settings, but have them only ever add notifications (never remove). Conceptually, it would be weird if following a topic cause you to get <em>fewer</em> notifications than other topics in the same stream. But you should be able to add whatever notifications you like.</p>

<p>Q. what would be the notification settings in such a case? (We can add, but can't remove)</p>
<p>Ans.<br>
It's probably simplest just to have a regular row of checkboxes in the UI, and not try to restrict how they are set. Otherwise, it'll get messy with specific per-stream settings and such. But the interpretation on the backend would be that if the stream has some type of notification turned on OR followed topics do, then a followed topic in that stream would get the notification.</p>

<p>I think <br>
<code>email</code> and <code>push</code> should be <code>True</code> by default and the rest of them as <code>False</code>. </p>
<p>Reason: To avoid the notifications from being too aggressive. (Users can always add notifications as per their preferences)</p>
<p>But again, "how much is too aggressive" can't be defined precisely.</p>

<p>IMO it is better to be more aggressive with these notifications since that might help with feature discovery (users who haven't read the help docs might not even know that followed topics can send notifications).</p>

<p>I think we're almost certainly going to change our mind as to what the right defaults are for this feature during its development; and it's very possible that we'll end up making the defaults depend on organization type. (In an open organization like this one, the concern is much more people not finding out that they missed something).</p>

<p>I would propose that we start with them all set to <code>True</code>, and plan to revisit that in the database migrations that add the settings for automatically following some topics, since in a world where you only follow topics via the manual action of selecting that you want to follow the topic, you probably do want to be notified about any activity there.</p>
