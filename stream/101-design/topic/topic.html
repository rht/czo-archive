<p>It is quite easy to a link to a stream by typing # followed by initial few letters of stream name. On the other hand to link to a topic it is necessary to paste full URL of topic (eg <a href="https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/design/subject/topic" target="_blank" title="https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/design/subject/topic">https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/design/subject/topic</a>) in message. Would it be a good idea to have</p>
<ul>
<li>Dropdown autocomplete for topics after entering a trigger key like # does for streams</li>
<li>If this is not initiative atleast replace the full url of a topic with a short version.(eg <a href="https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/design/subject/topic" target="_blank" title="https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/design/subject/topic">https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/design/subject/topic</a> would be replaced by <strong>%design/topic</strong>  by markdown processor)</li>
</ul>

<p>I think we have an issue somewhere suggesting a link-to-topic feature.</p>

<p>It does make sense to break the problem into two components, as I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-email="yo@vishnuks.com" data-user-id="52">@Vishnu Ks</span> is sort of alluding to:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to figure out the typeahead UI, even if typeahead, at the end of the day, just puts a long gross link into the message.</li>
<li>We need some sort of special markdown syntax that more concisely represents the link, similar to #design.</li>
</ul>
<p>We could solve the above problems more or less independently, and then the final integration step would be pretty easy (just have typeahead produce the markdown syntax instead of a link).</p>

<p>I think this is a feature we definitely want.  One thing to keep in mind is topics often have spaces.</p>

<p>So I think we'd probably want some sort of syntax that's like <br>
<code>#**stream name/topic name** (we'd need to be thoughtful about the separator</code>/`, since it would need to be basically banned in stream names)</p>
