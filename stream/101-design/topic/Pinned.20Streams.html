<p>Here is a feature suggestion, IMHO low-effort/high-benefit:<br>
Feature: <strong>Pin streams that are pinned</strong> (meaning, stay on top, do not scroll with the whole stream list)</p>

<p>the only potential problem I see is if you have a lot of pinned streams, you might not necessarily have a lot of room for the rest of the stream list, but I like the idea :)</p>

<p>Yeah, but why would you pin that many then :)</p>

<p>Pinning is useful if you have a lot of streams. I currently have 12 pinned streams, out of maybe 50 total?</p>

<p>I have almost 34 pinned streams. The only reason I don;t have any more is because pinned streams no longer fit in the screen :)</p>

<p>But in case when pinned streams are less, then it is very much useful to move out them from scrollView. (my case :))</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-email="vishnu@zulipchat.com" data-user-id="52">@Vishnu Ks</span> what is the point of having so many pinned streams? :)<br>
Wouldn't just unsubscribing from most you don't need and pin few be better?</p>

<p>Ha Ha. I pin streams which I am interested in. It started from around 3 or 4 and now reached almost 34.  I should probably start over :)</p>

<p>When I first read your suggestion I first thought it was a feature to pin the streams again among pinned streams which would be useful in my case ;)</p>

<p>I have 14 pinned streams; 23 more non-inactive streams (of which 8 are muted); and 18 more inactive streams (probably some of them muted.) So 55 total.</p>
<p>I pin streams that I want to be sure to catch up on even when I'm not caught up on everything -- so e.g. #announce, and <a class="stream" data-stream-id="31" href="/#narrow/stream/production%20help">#production help</a> , and some private streams like the one we use for logistical information (like lunch plans) around Kandra's San Francisco office.</p>

<p>I just went back through and unpinned a few streams that I can catch up on daily instead, or that were timely and no longer are. But I still have 10 pinned, and I think I want all of them there.</p>

<p>I don't unsubscribe from the rest, because I do actually want to catch up on them. (Or I expect @-mentions in them and want to respond to those.)</p>
