<p>I think <code>s</code> should either toggle between stream and topic narrow, or go straight to topic narrow, since that's almost always what you want. If we're changing this behavior, it would be good to do it before 1.7. Thoughts?</p>

<p>I think this would be worth working on, though I'm not sure what the right UI would be.</p>

<p>I like the toggle idea.  I don't think there's a tremendous use case for widening from topic -&gt; stream, but it's something people probably do, and I like the idea that hitting the key doesn't mysteriously noop.</p>
