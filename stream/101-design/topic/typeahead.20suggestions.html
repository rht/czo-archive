<p>Currently we only show typeahead suggestions after the user has entered a character. E.g. after <code>@x</code> rather than <code>@</code>. I was a proponent for the character after for a while, but after watching someone use Zulip today I realized that if you're not confident you're doing the right thing, having the typeahead show up immediately is nice. I think it's also compelling that other products seem to do it this way (tested github, slack, paper). </p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>I agree. It happens to me often with at and : across different products I like to confirm it’s possible by seeing a popup</p>

<p>I don't have a strong opinion here, but as long as there is some logical way to make suggestions on zero characters, which there almost always is, I say we should do it.</p>

<p>Usually alphabetical should be pretty logical or better yet contextual. But alphabetical is a good start.</p>

<p>I feel like having early-mention is a behavior which can be alternately annoying or useful depending on what you're trying to do and how good the suggestions are.  We might need to implement a different algorithm for that 0-character case than we want with a single character (because it should probably do alphabetical last in order to be net useful).</p>

<p>We could also replace this block:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/2/27/L9jBkG-2H0jqnZ2-k2Zsk0wk/pasted_image.png" target="_blank" title="pasted_image.png">pasted image</a> </p>

<p>I don't have a strong opinion on which way is correct for this in Zulip.</p>
