<p>As I suggested in the poll, I kinda want a back-button-on-steriods, but I intend that only to be sort of a shorthand label for what I want.  My wishes are slightly more nuanced than that.</p>

<p>I'm usually not in a huge rush to power through my unreads, so things kind of go in waves:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'll maybe skip 5 topics in a row that don't really interest me</li>
<li>I get to a topic where I stop to participate in the discussion.</li>
<li>I skip 3 more.</li>
<li>I get to a topic where all I want to do is react with a <span aria-label="thumbs up" class="emoji emoji-1f44d" role="img" title="thumbs up">:thumbs_up:</span> and quickly move on</li>
<li>I get to a topic where I follow a link.</li>
<li>I skip 4 more.</li>
<li>I get to a topic that I know concerns me, but it's too much to handle right away, so I star it.</li>
<li>I get back to power-through mode and skip or quickly respond to 10</li>

<p>So the question is why don't I just do this with the back button (or alt-left)?  Well, of course I do that if the topic was only 3 or 4 jumps back.  But the back-button approach doesn't really scale. And I want metadata like we have now (in the prototype) to remind me of stuff.</p>

<p>Does somebody want to elaborate on their most likely use case?  I can come back to mine later.  (For the record, I acknowledge that my predictions of how I use this may turn out to be wrong, as the actual use of the prototype might help me discover workflows that I didn't think were even possible.  So some of this is speculation, of course.)</p>

<p>Ah, so Steve, this workflow would be provided by the “All” view in recent topics? It keeps the meta of all recent discussions, in case one might want to easily “go back” and participate, reference, etc...</p>

<p>I actually want "Visited", not "All".  The current version of "All" includes topics that I haven't yet visited.  For me topics-that-I-haven't visited aren't interesting to me in the context of this dialog.  For messages that are still in <strong>my</strong> future (even though they've arrived to the client), I think those fall under a different use case (and mostly works now, see the <code>n</code> key).  I want Recent Topics for messages that are in <strong>my</strong> past.</p>

<p>Also, I definitely want multiple tab filters, to be clear.  I would want "visited" to be  my default, but then some other time I might have a topic where I definitely remember participating, and I just remember the name.</p>

<p>Not yet, at least not explicitly, but it's certainly something we can build.  Conceptually it's a pretty easy problem to just have a <code>touch_topic</code> function that we call every time we touch a topic in some meaningful way.</p>

<p>Yeah, that's fair.  It would be a relatively trivial thing to add backend support for if we had a Topic table.  If we had a Topic table, then you'd just need:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>UserTopic:
  user_profile_id
  topic_id
  last_visited
</code></pre></div>


<p>And <code>Topic</code> isn't a strong prerequisite if we're not overly concerned about long topic names:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>UserTopic:
  user_profile_id
  stream_id
  topic_name
  last_visited

<p>Would having a user preference for landing page in settings be an option?<br>
One of my pet peeves is coming to the All messages view and it marking messages as read so that when i hit "n" to go through unread topics I'm wondering which messages / topics lost their unread marks in that initial page load.</p>
<p>I can see arguments for people wanting to default to all messages, private messages, recent topics, mentions or maybe even be able to pick their own favourite stream/topic that they want to see when they drop into a server.</p>
<p>I don't know how complex this might be to implement, but everyone might have their own views on what the "best" default should be, so why not let everyone have it work the way that suits them?</p>
<p>(I hope this isn't going off at a tangent to the intent of this topic! My usual use case is to hit "n" and view every topic, mostly just skimming over ones I'm not involved in although I also sometimes star a post and check those topics manually. If this feature could offer a "topics with posts I have starred" view that would be really good as starring doesn't have unread counts so manually checking starred posts and scrolling to see if they have unread messages is quite inefficient!)</p>

<p>I guess this new recent topics feature is very useful and people are gonna use it very frequently<br>
One thing we can improve later on is to add a separate option in left-sidebar somewhere b/w global filter and Stream list I guess<br>
For those who don't use keyboard shortcuts that much that can be an accessibility improvement for recent topic over that small clock icon</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="15520">@Richard</span> I totally want a feature where you can set your home page to be something relaxing.  No messages, no chances of accidentally marking messages as read that require follow-up later, definitely no auto-scrolling.  Maybe a picture of some fish would be nice.  And a little note-taking widget.  Something where I can just take a break from the normal workflow.  As you alluded to, getting caught up on the <code>n</code> key often stresses me out.  I want to figuratively clean my desk after that, where my "desk" to clean is Zulip's middle pane.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="11296">@Siddharth</span> Yeah, I think if this feature is as popular as I predict (even with the slightly buggy roll-out, which is normal for this scope of feature), then we'll allocate a little more real estate for it than the clock icon.</p>

<p>My current thinking is that we'll remove "All messages" as the landing page in favor of this feature once it's polished.</p>

<p>I think that recent topics is a much better start page, especially for newer users, but also for old hands. I love All messages (I wished for it in FD), but it's better to start out at something that gives a better overview of where the action is. When I'm read up, All messages is great for staying up to date.</p>

<p>Hmm. It's not exactly clear to me what the objective there is, but I'll look at this more, with some time.</p>
