<p>I've been thinking about internet terminology, recently I mentioned a word that used to be super common several years ago, but someone had to look up in today's world <a href="#narrow/stream/138-user-community/topic/there.20can.20be.20only.20one.20(topic.20name)" title="#narrow/stream/138-user-community/topic/there.20can.20be.20only.20one.20(topic.20name)">https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/138-user-community/topic/there.20can.20be.20only.20one.20(topic.20name)</a>.</p>
<p>One of the phrases that bothers me is "Private message" and the shorthand: PM.<br>
I believe today's world has replaced these with the words "Direct message" and the shorthand: DM.</p>
<p>I believe usage of "PM" comes from IRC and forums and would look more and more off as trends shift. I'm not sure where "DM" comes from but <a href="/user_uploads/2/d8/QqYe8QlP09hiSwKKPaKO6Lnk/image.png" title="image.png">Slack</a>, <a href="/user_uploads/2/67/UbpWTg7RGqE3UoXrLWKQOEAg/image.png" title="image.png">twitter</a> and <a href="/user_uploads/2/19/jNEbGT1hZbDE0Ie1RXoNmuc5/image.png" title="image.png">discord</a> use the term direct.</p>

<p>The main advantage of "Direct message" as a term is it's more clear than "Private message" about the distinction between it and e.g. "Messages to private streams".</p>

<p>We would likely have details like the <code>private</code> message type staying around in the API for backwards-compatibility for years after changing what we call it in the UI, but I don't see technical concerns as a material issue around naming here.</p>

<p>The "private" =&gt; "direct" rename idea is likely much less expensive to do completely than <code>stream=&gt;channel</code>.  So might be worth doing as a warmup project if we think we want to do both.</p>

<p>Yeah, I do too in terms of my personal preference, though I'm not sure that alone is actually an important consideration. I guess one data point is that I haven't seen folks using the word "Direct message" to refer to private messages in Zulip, which would be the case if the term were strongly fixed in people's minds.</p>

<p>Just want to raise that again. Just because I realized that we have 3 types of streams:</p>
<ul>
<li>private stream</li>
<li>regular stream</li>
<li>public/global stream</li>
</ul>
<p>So the word <code>public/private</code> is already used in relation to  a stream. <br>
It would be great to have <code>direct messages</code> different in some way. <br>
Messages or conversations isn't different, because a user can message to a stream/topic.</p>
<p>And I think that idea of the message to a particular person isn't privacy of conversation but directness. <br>
When I message to a topic is not direct but it could be private. When I message to selected by me people it is  more about directness than privacy.</p>

<p>I certainly agree that it would make our documentation/terminology a bit easier if we moved away from the term "private messages" in favor of "direct messages". That may not necessarily justify a change, but it is a consideration.</p>

<p>For looking at what would be involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we're OK with changing nothing about the API or data model (i.e. just change user-facing strings, and worry about changing internals later), there's only about 50 translated strings that contain "private message" in them in the Zulip server and web application that would need to change. </li>
<li>There's a bit of a transition messyness if we rebrand this and don't simultaneously do a self-hosted server release and mobile app release, in that it'll be hard to run a self-hosted Zulip installation with consistent terminology around this.</li>
<li>There's probably a lot of work on the Help Center etc. after a rename, but it's probably not hard.</li>

<p>Doing this sort of change if we've decided to do it has two significant benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>While having design conversations, we can use the new terminology. There may be places where something looks better/worse with the slightly different string lengths, for example.</li>
<li>When doing new feature work, we can use the new names (for example, today, I thought about a name for a file that is <code>private_message_x</code> that we'd probably want to call <code>direct_message_x</code> if we were migrating).</li>
<li>We can start figuring out how to do the API migration, which is the kind of thing that might take like a year of staged transitions to complete for backwards-compatibility reasons ("subject" still exists in a couple places in our API, and we renamed "subject" to "topic" in the UI like 8 years ago!). The first step or two of that sort of staged migration might be a small amount of work, followed by a lot of waiting.</li>

<p>I think assuming folks continue to not complain about anything in the strings migration, we'll want to draft the documentation updates to go along with this change, and then merge those alongside the UI update. I think after that point, we'd be happy for the mobile and terminal apps to update their strings. </p>
<p>I think from a technical perspective, the change is something we could absolutely backport to the 6.x branch; the main issue with that will be translation coverage. So one theory for the release plan would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>We try to merge this PR to <code>main</code> and the <code>6.x</code> branch this week.</li>
<li>We immediately upload the updated strings for translators and post a request for them to translate these strings over the next couple weeks.</li>
<li>We potentially keep the commits reverted for Zulip Cloud pending client work.</li>
<li>We plan to do a 6.x maintenance release late this month, with "We renamed private message =&gt; direct message to match <code>main</code> and the mobile apps" as an important part of the release notes.</li>
<li>We do mobile/terminal releases aimed to be more or less simultaneous with the strings update.</li>
<li>Any API changes to name things more nicely for "direct messages" being what it's called would be for the <code>main</code> branch.</li>
</ul>

The other option is that Zulip Cloud and the mobile apps agree on "direct messages" but self-hosted installations have the old strings until we do a release 7.0, which I think is not the end of the world, but might make us feel like we should delay merging this until later in the release cycle.</p>

<p>I don't feel like it's a great backport.</p>
<p>But I also don't feel like it's the sort of thing that people will notice if they're comparing Zulip Cloud to their own deploy, so I don't think that there's a strong reason to hold off on merging it.</p>

<p>Well it certainly makes our lives easier to not try backporting it. The string change itself would backport easily, but the Help Center updates to go with it might not.</p>

<p>I am somewhat of the opinion that probably nobody will actually find it confusing at all to have a mismatch between the mobile/terminal apps and your self-hosted server... especially in this direction, because the mobile apps mostly use icons to indicate "private messages" in the main screens anyway; I think it's just the "New PM" and "New group PM" button strings...</p>

<p>Thanks! Posted a few review comments. I think the only detail that seems worth bringing up here is keyboard shortcuts. Right now, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>p</code> to go the first unread private message conversation</li>
<li><code>P</code> to jump to all private messages</li>
<li><code>d</code> to open drafts</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two key choices will be significantly less intuitive following this change. I'm not sure it's actually a problem to leave things as is, but I wanted to flag it as a potentially interesting design question.</p>

<p>So the documentation updates in <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/24337">#24337</a> are merged. There's basically two vestiges of "private messages" remaining in the web app UI:</p>
<ul>
<li>They keyboard shortcuts <code>p</code> and <code>P</code>. Given that <code>d</code> is already take by drafts, and that seems pretty intuitive, my current opinion is we should take no action here.</li>
<li>The search operators <code>pm-with:</code> and <code>group-pm-with</code> (<a href="https://zulip.com/help/search-for-messages#search-by-location">https://zulip.com/help/search-for-messages#search-by-location</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>For the search operators, I think it's worth having a conversation about what we want to change them to, since I think s/pm/dm/ is not the optional adjustment.</p>

<p>Now, these operators appear in the UI today via the top search box, but our plans for search involve users mostly just seeing fancier pills, so this decision probably has more long-term impact on the API. But I think it's still worth thinking about from a design perspective regardless.</p>

<p>The <code>pm-with:1,3,4</code> operator filters to the direct message conversation containing that exact set of users.  And <code>group-pm-with:1</code> filters to all direct message conversations that include that user (and possibly others!). You use multiple copies of <code>group-pm-with</code> to ask for multiple users.</p>
<p>(We support multiple encodings of users (email addresses and user IDs), but that's not really important for this discussion.).</p>

<p>My proposal is that we rename these to just <code>dm:1,3,4</code> and <code>dm-including:1</code> -- I think the <code>with</code> feels unnecessary in the first one, and <code>-including</code> seems a bit clearer to me than something like <code>group-dm-with</code>.</p>

<p>I guess it would be less helpful in the situation when you remember that something was a group DM (not a 1:1 DM) with person X, but can't specifically recall any other participants in the conversation. But that's probably rare enough to be fine, and the definition seems simpler than what we are currently using.</p>

<p>Having <code>dm-including</code> seems a good clarification of the current behavior, or at least a useful extension of it.</p>
<p>I'm in favor of <code>dm</code> due to how concise it could be, though I would be slightly concerned that it's <em>too</em> terse; <code>dm-with</code> is arguably clearer if we kept that, and should be distinct from <code>dm-including</code> in that case?</p>
<p>Re specifically group DMs, one alternative if we kept it, would be to support it as <code>dm-group[-with]</code>, since keeping the same prefix would be useful?</p>
<p>In terms of the last point, other than a rarity point of view, could one build combinations of different queries using the syntax we have or slight extensions? eg. if we added <code>is:dm-group</code> or similar (as opposed to current <code>is:private</code>? will that be <code>is:direct</code>?)</p>

<p>My only other thoughts on this are that we miss out on the plural form if we otherwise talk about DMs but use <code>dm</code>, though <code>dms</code> is not that great either. The other side of the coin is that we don't use 'message' everywhere else, so we could use <code>direct</code> instead.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, <code>is:private</code> should probably change to <code>is:direct</code>.</p>

<p><code>is:dm</code> might feel more intuitive? Maybe this is an incorrect intuition, but I feel like in other products, "DM" is used a lot more than "Direct messages", which biases me more towards the abbreviation spelling of it.</p>

<p>I don't like <code>dm-with</code> because it actually sounds like it's the same thing as <code>dm-including</code>... we thought about changing it when we introduced <code>group-pm-with</code>, but didn't muster the activation energy to do so at the time.</p>

<p>For the new "dm-including" operator, when there are no direct messages with the person (one-on-one or group), what do we want the empty banners to say? Both for the current user (note that most users will have a direct message from the Welcome bot and will never see this) and for another user.</p>
<p>My initial idea for the current user was: "You don't have any direct message conversations yet! Why not start a conversation with someone?"</p>
<p>And for another user was: "You have no direct messages including {person} yet. Why not start the conversation?"</p>

<p>I think it's likely that few users are familiar with group-pm-with, and those who know about it use it rarely, and those that do know about it will likely know how to navigate our search help, so I don't think there's any need for special logic of that form; we should just do something easy on that detail, which is probably translating it to the similar <code>dm-including</code> query. If it's equally easy, maybe the <code>dm-including</code> + <code>-dm</code> version is more precise, but I don't think it's worth much time/attention.</p>

<p>Hmm, if I type my name into the search bar, I get this autocomplete option among others:</p>
<p><a href="/user_uploads/2/c8/CJ8E20qR0O4feAk859YsKiND/image.png">image.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/c8/CJ8E20qR0O4feAk859YsKiND/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/c8/CJ8E20qR0O4feAk859YsKiND/image.png"></a></div><blockquote>
<p>Direct messages with <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="13313">Chris Bobbe</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I select it, the search bar gets filled in with <code>pm-with:user13313@chat.zulip.org</code> and the location bar changes to <code>https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/pm-with/13313-Chris-Bobbe</code>.</p>
<p>Instead, should the search bar get <code>dm:user13313@chat.zulip.org</code> and the location bar get <code>https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/dm/13313-Chris-Bobbe</code>?</p>
<p>Also, if I change the search term to that (<code>dm:user13313@chat.zulip.org</code>), then the location bar changes to <code>https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/search/dm.3Auser13313.40chat.2Ezulip.2Eorg</code> and there are no results. It looks like "dm" isn't being recognized as an operator.</p>
<p>Can anyone reproduce?</p>

<p>(Heh, well, that message I just sent now shows up in that query, presumably because it has the text <code>dm:user13313@chat.zulip.org</code>. <span aria-label="stuck out tongue" class="emoji emoji-1f61b" role="img" title="stuck out tongue">:stuck_out_tongue:</span>)</p>

<p>Make sure you've actually reloaded; the deployment actually happened something like 10 minutes later than my posting.</p>

<p>Ah got it, yeah it seems I didn't reload after the update. The issue isn't reproducing anymore.</p>
