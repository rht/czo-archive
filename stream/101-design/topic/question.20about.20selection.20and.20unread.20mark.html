<p>Hey guys, I have a stupid question. Why is bad to have only the selection box mark messages as read?</p>
<p>Yes in some cases you would need to scroll down a bit more, but users can't be certain without extra action that there is only one thing makes message as read.</p>
<p>I open a stream and I can see unread messages beyond the selection box, but don't mark them as read by doing nothing. Isn't that great?</p>
<p>Having selection box over a message is like clicking on email in Gmail. But it is still possible to look for email title in the Gmail.</p>
<p>It feels like straightforward mechanics is better than the one we as creators struggled to understand clearly.</p>

<p>As a user, I would prefer the model that Vlad is proposing, if I understand it correctly.  I never want Zulip to mark things as read beyond the cursor unless I have explicitly done something like hit the End key.</p>
<p>The problem with changing the current behavior is that lots of users seem to appreciate the convenience that Zulip assumes, in most  cases, that you are reading every message on the page, not just the selected one.  And that's usually a realistic assumption.</p>

<p>On the mobile app I have turned on the setting where literally <strong>no</strong> messages get marked as read automatically, and I always have to hit the button.  This experience has been ideal for me on the mobile side.</p>

<p>Thank you for telling me its possible, now I'm interested to see how to do so.</p>
<p>It looks like when you don't have a selection cursor you might agree with "Zulip assumes, in most cases, that you are reading every message on the page" and you do want an option to mark messages as read via a button (I also think its a good feature to bring to the desktop version, because now it takes 2 clicks).</p>
<p>Isn't that more solid mental model?:</p>
<ol>
<li>if you have selection box, only this is marking messages as read (like keyboard oriented navigation)</li>
<li>if you don't have selection box the act of opening a page with messages does it (like on mobile right now)</li>
</ol>
<p>And the nice thing for the 1 option is that it can live even without an option to switch that off. In this case there could be a question in the users mind: "How do I mark them as read?", and the answer is "just scroll a bit deeper".</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't understand how do we get that information? Are those users who also enjoys keyboard nav and a selection box? Are they who don't like or use the selection box? I have hard time imagining that a person likes both ways at the same time, because the do conflict.</p>

<p>We have done a lot of experimentation with our paradigms for marking messages as read, and they always elicit user feedback.</p>

<p>The current behavior where messages get marked as read by the blue box or if you can see the bottom of the thread is kind of funky, but at least with how I read my messages, I really wouldn't want to always scroll the blue box all the way through my messages in order to mark them read. If anything, I would like to have messages get marked as read with me doing <em>less</em> work when I'm quickly skimming through a bunch of threads (i.e. just by being on the screen). But it's possible this would cause one to accidentally lose unread counts in a way that's annoying.</p>

<p>No, I don't think it would be confusing for me (not sure about new users). But I do think I might find it annoying because it would require more scrolling to get everything marked as read.</p>

<p>Ok. So we are balancing 2 annoyings. Either scroll a bit more to mark as read or have the current behavior when selection box isn’t marking things as read (or some complex logic behind it). Is it correct?</p>

<p>I think there's some correlation:<br>
one pattern likes the selection box, tends to use the keyboard, and doesn't want messages marked as read by just being on screen<br>
other pattern tends to use the mouse, wants all on-screen messages to be marked as read, and maybe doesn't see much use for the selection box<br>
(at least, that's my read)</p>

<p>Right, for example I use <code>n</code> to go between topics, but the mouse to scroll within a topic. I generally use <code>c</code> to compose, but haven't internalized any of the message-related keyboard shortcuts (so I might not need the blue box). But I can imagine, e.g., learning to use <code>+</code> or <code>&gt;</code> while still using the mouse to scroll, in which case I <em>would</em> need the blue box.</p>

<p>That is a nice thing… we don’t have such setting for the desktop, right?</p>

<p>We should probably add some version of it -- the mobile setting is relatively new from a product standpoint, and we also would need to add UI for letting you mark all as read (basically extending the banner we merged today in <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/6afdf2410d0b9504ba2d36a7b4e23ff34c34582e">6afdf2410d0b9504ba2d36a7b4e23ff34c34582e</a> to have a different string if you have this setting enabled, maybe with some additional changes).</p>

<p>UI for making all messages as read is scroll-down arrow, right?</p>

<p>It's the End key or mac equivalent. (or <code>G</code>)</p>
