<p>We got a suggestion from a user for a feature  that to me personally sounds super useful - being able to bind certain streams to numbers, so that each such stream can be navigated to with a keyboard shortcut with the number - for example Ctr+1, Ctr+2 etc. </p>
<p>Any thoughts on whether others agree with this being something we want, and if so, what the keyboard shortcut should be?</p>

<p>Hey guys, just wanted to chime in with my 2 cents. </p>
<p>I heavily use one or two streams at a time, and most of the time I'm bouncing between topics. Ideally, when  I use apps a lot, I like to use shortcut keys as much as possible, so that I'm basically just using my lizard brain to use the tools, (in this case navigating to the right stream/topic) and reserving my exec center for the tasks that need it (composing messages). Often when I am using Zulip, I have a thought in my head, or a response, and I'd like to get it written out in the right location without using the executive center in my brain.</p>
<p>For my case, ideally there would be a global keybinding  that quickly places me somewhere I could type a few letters of the topic, hit enter and start typing my message.  I'm aware there is a path to doing this using key commands only, but they are conditional (you cant be in edit mode) and they require a specific order.  This means that in practice, I have to engage my executive center in order to find the right topic to sent the message in. And it's not for lack of trying.  This may sound a bit dramatic, but as someone who works with ADD, I'm particularly sensitive to this while working,</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="20781">@Alexx Henry</span> thanks for the feedback!  Can you talk a bit more about the situation you're in when you want such a keybinding?  I can imagine <code>c</code> doing what you want, but I don't think I have enough context on the situation to be sure. </p>
<p>(That opens the compose box with the current stream and focus in the topic input box).</p>

<p>I think this is one reason that <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="20781">Alexx Henry</span> doesn't find <code>c</code> alone to be a solution:</p>

<p>I think one habit I have in using Zulip (and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="20781">@Alexx Henry</span>, you might or might not find this helpful) is that before typing a navigation command like <code>c</code> or <code>n</code> or <code>t</code>, I'll hit the Up or Down arrow key a couple of times.</p>
<p>This has the effect of closing the compose box, if it's open but empty. And if it's already closed, it's basically harmless, just moves the blue-box cursor a couple of messages.</p>
<p>For me, I think it isn't common that I'll have the compose box open and have text in it, unless I'm actively thinking about an in-progress message. But it is common to have the compose box open and empty. So this is a way of resetting the state to "compose box is closed", without first looking to see if it is.</p>

<p>Hmm, and perhaps relatedly: just after sending that message, I noticed that I hit the arrow keys to move the cursor up and down a few messages.</p>
<p>I think that's probably also a habit -- probably I often do that after sending a message, if I don't intend to immediately send another. That's also a way of resetting the state to "compose box empty", so that navigation commands are available.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="7">@Tim Abbott</span> </p>
<p>I'll speak first to what I want to acomplish: Often I have a thought in my head, and I want to quickly get it out and into a message in the appropriate topic. What I would like is for a method to quickly access the target topic, even if I only have a fuzzy idea of what it's called. </p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="2187">@Greg Price</span> 's comment is correct. Because c is modal, it often requires <code>c</code> <code>escape</code> <code>c</code>, which takes me out of the zone. I do use vim, so i'm ok with modal programs, but the bigger issue i have with <code>c</code> is that it requres me to be in a specific stream.</p>
<p>Getting to the stream is also modal, and I think the combination of <code>q</code> <code>text</code> <code>t</code> <code>t</code> <code>text</code>, etc... in practial use winds up being too high friction for me to use consistantly.</p>

<p>a non-modal keybinding that was like <code>c</code> but that would seach across all topics would acutally solve my problem, but I'm sure there are many ways to acheive this.</p>

<p>One thing you can do is hit <code>c</code> -- or if you're already in the compose box, then skip that step -- and then go and edit the field that says what stream you're sending to.</p>
<p>The stream and topic fields are both editable, just like the message content is.</p>
<p>You can get to that field with the mouse, or with normal keyboard UI navigation by hitting Shift+Tab a couple of times.</p>

<p>Honestly if there were a non-modal method to quickly nav to a stream, then I think hitting <code>c</code> once I'm there is totally reasonable, and b/c I would be getting there the same way, the modality of <code>c</code> wouldnt matter. </p>
<p>I know it seems like I'm being nit picky, but I promise I'm putting in the effort to try to make it work for me, and for some reason hitting <code>q</code>, then somethimes realizing I need to hit escape then <code>q</code>, then the rest.. it almost always winds up taking me out of the zone.</p>

<p>That one deliberately works even if you have the compose box open. It opens the search bar, and one of the things you can do there is go to a stream or a topic.</p>

<p>I think the original idea when we picked that binding for that functionality was that it'd be a form of global quick navigation -- basically exactly what you're looking for here, I think.</p>
<p>I'm not sure we've entirely realized that vision as things stand, but if not then perhaps that's a direction to work in.</p>

<p>I find Ctrl+K to be too <em>everthing but the kitchen sink</em> for it to be usefull for a rapid navigation. I like the idea... It's what I used to use in Slack, and what works well in Monday, but I haven't had luck here.</p>
