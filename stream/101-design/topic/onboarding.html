<p>This is the old one, but probably there are still good ideas to take from it:<br>

<p>I found the 5th point of 2nd link interesting. <br>
<strong>Placed mission critical information upfront</strong><br>
Slack previously used “hotspots” to introduce users to important UI elements. These hotspots would pulse until a user clicked on them, then disappear once the user had read the tip. <br>
The hotspots from the old onboarding experience are a nice way of providing users the contextual guidance they need in an unintrusive manner. They allow users to consume information when they are ready to rather than making it a prescriptive part of the experience.<br>
Their click rates, however, can be low. So when you have mission critical information that a user must know to be successful, sequential hotspots are the pattern of choice.</p>

<p>I just made an account on a Discourse instance for the first time. It's a discussion system (more "forum" than "chat"), with a bunch of things they want you to know to get the most out of it, so they have an interactive onboarding bot. It was pretty good!</p>
<p>I recommend trying out the experience live -- it took me 5m -- by making an account at <a href="https://try.discourse.org/" target="_blank" title="https://try.discourse.org/">https://try.discourse.org/</a>.</p>

<p>Among the neat things it did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Step by step the bot asked me to try a thing, then I did it, and it replied. It sounded throughout like a super-friendly encouraging coach-human.</li>
<li>Some of the things were replying to it (to try out markup features). Others were other actions in the app -- so it needed some magic to know when I did those.</li>
</ul>
