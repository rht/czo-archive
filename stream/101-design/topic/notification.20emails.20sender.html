<p>Separately, it feels weird to me that we invite users to reply to <code>noreply@zulip.com</code>. For reference, GitHub uses <code>notifications@</code>.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="22433">@Vlad Korobov</span> had the same feedback when we chatted recently, and <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="2" href="/#narrow/stream/2-general/topic/email.20inconsistency">#general &gt; email inconsistency</a> raises it as well.</p>

<p>There may be options for making this better, but many email providers for security/anti-spam reasons limit what you can use as the sender for an email -- so at least in many self-hosting systems, the Zulip server only has permission to send as 1-2 fixed email senders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do we know if the above concerns actually prevent us from using <code>noreply@zulip.com</code>? Is this something that could be customized for Zulip Cloud if not for self-hosters?</p>

<p>I think the thing we can do is make a <code>MESSAGE_NOTIFICATION_SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS</code> server setting whose default is <code>NOREPLY_EMAIL_ADDRESS</code> but which can be changed, and then self-hosters who can't send from a bonus email address with their email provider can just not change that setting, but we'd be able to improve this for Zulip Cloud and selfhosters who can.</p>
