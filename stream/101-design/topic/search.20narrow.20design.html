<p>When you use a filter such as "sent by me", you some subset of messages. Now, within this subset, some messages might be from the same topic, but they may not be actually consecutive ie actually "foo" topic could have a message by A, then one by B, then one by C, then another by A.<br>
Our current narrow logic is that if two messages are from the same topic, instead of showing the FRB twice, they're joined together. This makes sense because obviously, this is one thread, it looks better this way.<br>
However, consider if A used sent by me filter in above example, then they see their two messages and it appears in that search as though they were actually sent consecutively, and this is somewhat weird/confusing.</p>

<p>I also get confused by search results that look contiguous but really aren't.  I prefer the way Slack handles this, where each message in the search result is formatted as its own little card.  I also like that Slack search results actually look like "search results" instead of a different message feed (while obviously maintaining the same look&amp;feel to some degree).</p>
<p>It's also worth nothing that it's pretty difficult for us, during most searches, to know whether messages were contiguous in the original conversation.</p>

<p>I think there might just be a bug in this case; I think we have logic when searching to do a separate recipient block/card for each match, and maybe the issue is just that the logic only applies to full-text search.</p>

<p>We should open an issue for this.  It shouldn't be hard to define a helper function in <code>filter.js</code> that defines when one can collapse adjacent messages; it'll end up being roughly the same as <code>can_mark_messages_read</code> but should have its own name.</p>

<p>I didn't mean to imply it would be easy, and it is worth discussing the ways in which we could achieve an ideal solution (collapse only actually consecutive) to this problem.</p>
<p>That said, I feel as though "separating all messages when searching" would be <strong>better</strong> than what we have currently (sometimes joining non-consecutive messages", I think referring to the table in <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="101" href="/#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/top.20navbar">#design &gt; top navbar</a> can <em>help decide</em> which narrows count as "searching" however, the exact list of "collapse-able narrows" <strong>maybe different</strong> from the "searching narrows" presented in that table. (Although if it just happens to be the same, we can just use the helper I'm defining there).</p>

<li>pm-with views</li>
<li>Left sidebar views (whether per-stream or per-topic)</li>

<p>The condition here is gonna pretty close to <code>!can_mark_messages_read()</code>, since it's sort of the same category of views, but I agree with Tim to just do <code>is:search</code> for now.  The filter piece of this will be pretty straightforward once we're happy with the UI.</p>
