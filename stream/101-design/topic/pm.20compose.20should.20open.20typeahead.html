<p>In line with <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/11682" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/11682">#11682</a>, should the <code>To</code> line on the PM compose box also immediately open the user typeahead?</p>

<p>So, I have some hesitation around this feature.  One reason is that typeahead can be big/distracting, and user lists are generally a lot longer than stream lists.</p>

<p>(Right now, that typeahead is positioned in a way it's limited to showing 3 options)</p>

<p>So I think we should first experiment with showing typeahead in the streams box and go from there.</p>

<p>(typeahead with useless options is can be negative utility)</p>

<p>So my thought is:</p>
<ul>
<li>We try doing typeahead by default in the streams box, and see how it goes.  </li>
<li>If that ends up being unexpectedly bad, which I think is possible, we look at doing a hotspot for the first time you have an empty stream box in compose.</li>
</ul>

<p>ok, I'm fine with serializing it that way. But I do think the "standard" UX advice would be to put a typeahead in the <code>To</code> field, despite it potentially being uglier for experienced users.</p>

<p>Is the context here that you're in a stream narrow and hit "New private message"?</p>

<p>For me the ideal experience there would be to pop a modal with a list of recent conversations, and just click on "Alice", and then the app would put me in the compose box ready to type my message.  (The modal would also have a way to search for people and/or hand-type the addressee with typeahead.)  This is more or less how mobile works, conceptually at least.</p>

<p>(For the short term plan, I agree with Tim's hesitation to change things here until we try the stream experiment.)</p>

<p>Thankfully, our typeahead in the compose box is pretty smart.  In some more obscure parts of the app, like "Create Stream", it's super difficult to autocomplete common names like "Tim Abbott".  But I've also run into problems in the compose box.  If somebody has a common name, but I haven't talked to them recently, it can literally be impossible to get to them in typeahead, since we truncate at 5 items.  Whereas mobile does the right thing--just have an easy link to do a true search.</p>

<li>click people icon</li>
