<p>I was looking at issue <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/6032" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/6032">#6032</a> which talks about having a description for a stream appear when one hovers over it in a message. We could do this by using a popover with a template for stream descriptions: <a href="/user_uploads/2/62/qLhbzfzT7o3dvXrtMYiF4srH/pasted_image.png" target="_blank" title="pasted_image.png">Style 1</a> or we could use a tool tip <a href="/user_uploads/2/ac/qUX0hiYHEeFHkD78K4YAF5sP/pasted_image.png" target="_blank" title="pasted_image.png">Style 2</a> , we could have further styling for both options, I'd like feedback on which would be preferred. Also, in both these examples, I have it set so that the description is trimmed to about 80 characters (drops out last word and further if we go above that, I will make it add ellipses to the trimmed string later), is there any preferred character limit I should use?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="9808">@Yash RE</span> this is cool. Hopefully stream names are descriptive enough to not need too much additional context. If you’re looking for issues to pick up I’m sure this place has enough people to guide you towards good frontend issues to tackle <span aria-label="slight smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="slight smile">:slight_smile:</span> hope I’m not speaking out of turn</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="9808">@Yash RE</span> That looks pretty nice!  I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="131">@Rishi Gupta</span> is the best person to decide here.  There's some discussion in <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/6032" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/6032">#6032</a> that we think the hovers would be more annoying than helpful. If that's the case, we should just close the issue.  I'm the original author of the issue, but I think I was just writing it up based on suggestions from <a class="stream" data-stream-id="137" href="/#narrow/stream/137-feedback">#feedback</a> or something.</p>

<p>Woops, okay, I'll wait and see if <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="131">@Rishi Gupta</span>  says if we'll need this or not. I went though the discussion on the issue and a few other  issues, I think the average user would get the sense that stream descriptions don't show up apart from the start of a stream. We should shut down  <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/5198" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/5198">#5198</a> and the associated WIP PR as well.</p>

<p>I tihnk I'm slightly inclined against having these. The stream descriptions are also about to become a lot more prominent, since we're going to be adding them to the nav bar area at the top of the screen. </p>
<p>As a general tip, issues without <code>help wanted</code> or <code>good first issue</code> are somewhat dangerous to work on, since generally it means there isn't yet consensus on the right way forward.</p>

<p>I'll send in a PR with the approaches as much as I've worked on them and then close it (in case in the future we change our mind and someone else works on it) and I'll also mention that we decided against it and link here</p>
