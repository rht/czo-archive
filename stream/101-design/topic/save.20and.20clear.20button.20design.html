<p>Hey Guys,<br>
What do you think about the "Save and Clear" button design?</p>

<p>Hm, it looks a little funny next to the "Press Enter to send" text... I wonder if it would be better if it had white text on a darker background, to be more similar to the <strong>Send</strong> button?</p>

<p>Yeah, good point -- it might cause people to think it's not saving as you go along... I was leaning towards writing out the words because I couldn't think of an icon that would actually express the full action, though of course we could have a tool tip to describe it.</p>

<p>I think the bottom right is nice conceptually, in that it's an alternative to clicking <code>Send</code>. If you're not going to send another message right now (i.e. you're thinking about the <code>x</code> button), there's no reason to <code>save &amp; clear</code> your draft. But I don't have a great solution for making the visual design look nice.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure what the intended UX is here. Is the idea that this is for the use case of, I'm in the middle of composing a long message and there's something new I want to make a quick reply to first?</p>
<p>(IOW, what a hotkeys user might do with Escape, c.)</p>
<p>After sending the quick reply, what happens next, and how does the user go on to resume the draft where they left off?</p>

<p>This is to unblock us loading drafts into the composebox by default, right? If so, I'm not totally convinced by this approach — it's a lot of screen real estate for what I'd imagine is a pretty uncommon action, and one that users probably have more intuitive ways to deal with (copy draft, paste into text editor/doc/etc, write quick reply, copy draft back over). Or even write short response above the draft, cut the draft, send the short response, and paste the draft back into the composebox so it's re-saved.</p>
<p>This seems like a very niche feature, which is unlikely to be very generally useful or understandable, and my preference would be to just have it so that one can only have one draft per topic (or, if we think that will seriously annoy power users, add an option to disable auto-loading drafts, which we will possibly want to do anyways).</p>

<p>I also think it would be fine to special-case the case where someone does Ctrl+A, Backspace or some other method of deleting all of the text in the composebox at once (triple-click, etc), and preserving the draft in that case — I think that'll be much more useful to people, since a significant number of people probably already delete unwanted messages in that way.</p>

<p>Yeah, I certainly am not happy with the visuals of what has been prototyped here.  It's worth thinking about the fact that we already have a "Drafts" thing in the compose box that is invisible to people; it's possible that we want to be extending/adjusting that instead visually.</p>

<p>One not super thought out idea I've had in this space is what if there's some sort of <code>Up/Down</code> style keyboard shortcut to cycle through drafts to that recipient without leaving the leaving the compose box.  E.g. maybe <code>Alt+Up</code> would take you to an empty/new draft and <code>Alt+Down</code> would take you to the next draft (if any) to that recipient.</p>
<p>And then we'd have some sort of up/down widgets attached to a "Drafts" thingy as well for mouse users.</p>

<p>I agree showing the  "Save &amp; Clear" button looks a bit odd. </p>
<p>How about if we instead show the <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/trash_2424877?term=recycle%20bin&amp;page=1&amp;position=11&amp;page=1&amp;position=11&amp;related_id=2424877&amp;origin=tag">recycle bin icon</a> with the tooltip of "Save and Clear".<br>

<p>P.S: I agree that the user might confuse it with the "Delete All" button, but it also does that.</p>

<p>I also think it would be fine to special-case the case where someone does Ctrl+A, Backspace or some other method of deleting all of the text in the composebox at once (triple-click, etc), and preserving the draft in that case — I think that'll be much more useful to people, since a significant number of people probably already delete unwanted messages in that way.</p>

<p>One not super thought out idea I've had in this space is what if there's some sort of <code>Up/Down</code> style keyboard shortcut to cycle through drafts to that recipient without leaving the leaving the compose box.  E.g. maybe <code>Alt+Up</code> would take you to an empty/new draft and <code>Alt+Down</code> would take you to the next draft (if any) to that recipient.</p>
<p>And then we'd have some sort of up/down widgets attached to a "Drafts" thingy as well for mouse users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like that idea as a replacement for a <code>Save &amp; Clear</code> button! Maybe just up and down triangles (carets) next to <code>Drafts</code> for cycling through with the mouse, including the up one having the save &amp; clear functionality when  you're at the top draft already?</p>

<p>I would consider implementing it as keyboard-only as a first commit, because I expect the hard part of this feature will be figuring out the mouse UI for it, and that may involve a lot of iteration on the visuals wrapping calls to the functions we write for iterating through drafts.</p>

<p>Now, it will only load the draft if the composed state recipient matches the draft's recipient. </p>

<p>P.S: I avoided going with the current narrow state as sometimes it might be confusing for the user.

<p>Though, if we want to go with the current narrow state then I just need to change one line.<br>

<p>One comment on the UI, which may continue to be relevant if we move the widget, is that it's currently not very clear that the arrows are associated with Drafts, as opposed to being an unrelated widget. Playing with spacing (putting the arrows clearly closer to Drafts than anything else) should help.</p>
<p>I think having the arrows be a  different color than the <code>Drafts</code> link is another reason they don't look obviously related.</p>

<p>Hey folks, I was just going through my pending PRs. <br>
I am curious, do we still need this feature (Rotating drafts in compose box with the help of buttons or keyboard shortcut)?</p>

<p>Instead of having the buttons in the compose, we could make the <code>Drafts</code> tooltip interactive with those buttons.</p>

<p>I think there are two design issues here:</p>
<p><strong>(1) How to view multiple drafts for a conversation if multiple exist</strong></p>
<p>The rotation idea sounds nice for keyboard users.</p>
<p>For mouse users: I think we could have the "Drafts" button open <em>only the drafts for the current narrow/conversation</em>.</p>
<p><strong>(2) How to start a new message when a draft has been autoloaded in the compose box</strong></p>
<p>The keyboard-powered message rotation could eventually lead to an empty compose box, but I feel like that wouldn't be very intuitive.</p>
<p>I'm not really sure what the best thing to do in this situation is, and that's also where the "save and clear" button idea came from. I think a button like that would actually be something more like "start new message", at least in terms of functionality that we want to communicate to the user. It's less about saving (since we regularly do that anyways), and more about clearing the compose box to allow a new draft to be started. But I agree a button is pretty clunky. Curious if people have further thoughts on what experience would be good here.</p>

<p>Mmm, something like that could work. One possibility is to have two tabs in Drafts, something like "This conversation" and "All". We could be a bit smart about which one to show when the user opens the drafts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the "All" tab and disable the "This conversation" tab when there are no drafts in the current context.</li>
<li>Open the "This conversation" tab from the compose box Drafts link.</li>
<li>(perhaps) Open the "All" tab from the left sidebar link, or maybe make it dependent on whether the compose box is open of closed.</li>
</ul>

<p>That actually seems like something we could do independently of the restoring drafts feature; we could also decide whether we still want arrows for cycling through drafts for the current narrow or not.</p>

<p>Yeah, that might be a better name. Since we don't expect it to be used all that often, we might be able to hide it under a menu attached to the "send" button, e.g. in the new design:</p>
<p><a href="/user_uploads/2/49/l7yov9svlwTP4rGvLBzupMxI/Screen-Shot-2022-04-04-at-1.09.28-PM.png">Screen-Shot-2022-04-04-at-1.09.28-PM.png</a> </p>

<p>How about we add two sub-sections("All" and "This conversation") under the left sidebar draft link that opens up when the link is clicked? We can then have the "This conversation" link disabled if there is no draft for the current conversation. I guess this could help eliminate any confusion?</p>
