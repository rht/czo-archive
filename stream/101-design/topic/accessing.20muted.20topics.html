<p>with time user will forget which topics the user has muted, and if due to some reason the user needs to see some muted topics, it's a long process of going to settings and viewing muted topics there, which I think user will forget.<br>
currently there's only one place i.e user settings where one can view all of their muted topics,<br>
but I don't think a new user of <strong>Zulip</strong> will know this. Even I didn't knew where to see all my muted topics till I opened settings for changing my profile pic.</p>
<p>We can increase the accessibility of muted topics by adding a button below or above <strong>+ Add streams</strong> saying <strong>Muted topics</strong> which may either open the muted topics tab in settings or list all muted topics in the central area (message area) whichever is feasible.<br>
What say?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="17415">@RISHABH D TIWARI</span> u can see your muted topics in recent topics by checking include muted.</p>

<p>I do agree that it would be nicer to have a more discoverable way to manage your muted topics.  OTOH I am a bit reluctant to take up too much main-screen real estate for muted topics.  In my experience I have almost never regretted forgetting about a muted topic, because if somebody really needs my attention, they can still get it.</p>

<p>If we had to add it anywhere on the main screen, though, I think putting a handy link at the bottom of your stream list, as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="17415">@RISHABH D TIWARI</span> suggests, would be as good a place as any.</p>

<p>I agree with your point <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="5140">@Aman Agrawal</span> , but in recent topics there are unmuted topics too, which gives a clustered look.<br>
A nice place to manage muted topics will be better.</p>

<p>I agree <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="58">@Steve Howell</span>  that generally we wouldn't regret forgetting about muted topic, but this will be when we mute topic intentionally.<br>
But if one mutes the topic by mistake, it would be better to give the user a place to manage it easily.<br>
This idea itself clicked me when to test muting of topics, I muted some topics in <a class="stream" data-stream-id="1" href="/#narrow/stream/1-announce">#announce</a>  and some other streams but then couldn't find where to unmute them</p>

<p>should I create an issue and start working on this? Please confirm.</p>
