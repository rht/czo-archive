<p>This is referenced to issue <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/7475" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/7475">#7475</a>.<br>
<strong>Current situation</strong>: When user create a stream, we automatically subscribe the user for that stream. So we don't show user name in <code>People to add</code> list.<br>
<strong>According to <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/7475" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/7475"><a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/7475" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/7475">#7475</a></a></strong>: We should show user who is creating stream in <code>People to add</code> list</p>
<p><strong>What I have implemented in PR <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/7524" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/7524"><a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/7524" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/7524">#7524</a></a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Current user will be shown on top of People to add list</li>
<li>By default current user's checkbox will be checked</li>
<li>If user try to create a stream in which he/she is not subscribed, then the warning box will appear to warn user, saying You are not subscribed to stream with two options Go back and Yes, create stream</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is that, this can create a scenario where user try to create a private stream, in which he/she is not subscribed.<br>
If we want to prevent user to creating stream in which he/she is not subscribed, then we can </p>
<ul>
<li>Show current user on top of <code>People to add</code> list with default value checked</li>
<li>Prevent user to change value of that particular checkbox.(disable the uncheck operation for that option)</li>
</ul>
<p>In this way, user will know that he/she is subscribed and can not create stream without subscription. <br>
Which one we should implement here?<br>

If we're going to make the experiences more similar, I'd like to start removing code, not adding code.  (The only main difference between create-stream and edit-stream should be copy-subscribers-from-stream, and even maybe that should apply to edit as well.)</p>

<p>All users can create streams, at least private streams, and they go through the "add" workflow.</p>
<p>All users can edit streams, at least private streams, and they go through the "edit" flow to add subscribers (or remove them if they have admin privileges).</p>
<p>I <strong>think</strong> I'm right about the above, but the more central point is that the UI for these are completely different for legacy reasons.</p>

<p>No, but I think it will be confusing if it's a private stream. Cause if user will create a private stream then he/she can not edit stream options further.<br>

<p>I'm a little wary of changing the status quo.  For private streams, I think it almost always make sense that you'd want to implicitly subscribe yourself, and there are lots of edge cases if you don't.</p>
<p>For public streams, I think it's mostly the case that you want to subscribe yourself, even when you're in the admin role, and you can always unsubscribe quickly.</p>

<p>We have a setting "Prevent users from creating streams", in which case the admin creating streams they don't want to be in seems like more of a possibility. <br>
Also, it seems like I can unsubscribe from private streams I create as Iago, which suggests that we're already having to deal with all the corner cases?</p>

<p>I'm not too worried about the usability for admins, to be honest.  As an admin myself, I usually want to either be a permanent stream member or remain just long enough to make sure it gets started ok.</p>

<p>For the unsubscribe-privates scenario, I believe we already have code or a pending PR for the last-to-leave case, but that code isn't directly reusable for the create-stream case.  Since users can create their own private streams, it's rare that admins need to be involved, and if we do get involved, we usually want to babysit the stream for a bit before we unsubscribe.</p>

<p>I think users can't create private streams with "Prevent users from creating streams" is on? <br>
I think one of the reasons for that settings is to prevent people from using your (public) server's bandwidth to host their private chats :).</p>

<p>Also to be clear, my motivation for this is largely to avoid the complexity of special casing the stream creator in the stream creation flow, since they aren't special cased elsewhere. I agree the situation of an admin creating a private stream they are not on is rare enough that either way (allowing or disallowing in the creation flow) is fine.</p>

<p>It's true that a legit newbie who wants a private stream might have to enlist an admin, but I think it's a rare scenario, and the admin will almost always want to babysit the stream for a while.</p>

<p>As for "special casing", I think it's appropriate to special-case the individual creating the stream.  We know they're somewhat likely to want to be subscribed.  The problem is not so much that we special case; it's more that our UI is unclear.  I'd want to special-case the UI with a checkbox like</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>[x] subscribe yourself
</pre></div>

<p>We actually have two separate settings, one for newbie protection, and one for bandwidth protection, though that isn't clear from the settings page (opened <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/7617" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/7617">#7617</a> to fix).</p>
<p>In any case, I'm fine either way. If we stay with the status quo, I'm in favor of:<br>
<code>Prevent user to change value of that particular checkbox.(disable the uncheck operation for that option)</code></p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-email="greg@zulipchat.com" data-user-id="2187">@Greg Price</span> Have you tried to create a stream on this realm lately with more than 3 or 4 people?  I think you'll understand why the checkbox-for-each-user approach is a way bigger problem here.  So I go back to the earlier advice on this thread that we might want to do something a lot more like our stream-edit approach.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-email="showell@zulipchat.com" data-user-id="58">@Steve Howell</span> Oh, definitely agreed that we can improve this UI more generally!</p>
<p>I just don't want that bigger project to stop us from doing the simplest fix here. I think the design <span class="user-mention" data-user-email="yashashvidave@gmail.com" data-user-id="3244">@Yashashvi Dave</span> decribes in the PR comment makes sense:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Current user will be shown on top of <code>People to add</code> list </li>
<li>By default current user's checkbox will be checked</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm inclined to just skip this part:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If user try to create a stream in which he/she is not subscribed, then the warning box will appear to warn user, saying <code>You are not subscribed to stream</code> with two options <code>Go back</code> and <code>Yes, create stream</code></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>because I think if the user explicitly unchecks that box, they probably don't need an extra box about that.</p>

<p>I don't understand the second comment. Do you just mean putting an &lt;hr&gt; between the two sections? Also the color is a personal preferences setting, not a global color; maybe that needs to be made clearer.</p>

<p>The simpler the screen, the easier/lighter the process seems and the more people will do it. We can just offer them 1-2 things, maybe just 'name, description, color, public' with everything else hidden behind an 'advanced' button or even saved for future edits.</p>

<p>Creating a stream, and adding users to it are two separate steps, the 'adding user' step being one that people would want to do multiple times. It is very much a best-practice to split them.</p>

(And yeah, I assume the perf issue is just due to the long user list.)</p>
<p>Another big stream creation simplification I think would be to simplify the semantics of "Copy from stream". I think that can instead limit you to choose at most 1 stream at a time, and then give you the option "Add users of stream X to current stream" or "Replace membership of current stream with membership of stream X".</p>

(I think multi-panel is a huge improvement over the existing UI, so I'd be willing to merge it even less-than-perfect.)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-email="hkmp7tommy@gmail.com" data-user-id="714">@Tommy Ip</span> what are you referring to with the bootstrap primary button style? The <code>.btn.btn-primary</code> class group? We don't use that anymore in the codebase, and I'd recommend against using it in the future.</p>

We should make sure we're all agreed on the design before going too far in this direction, though (in general, issues with <code>help wanted</code> are the ones where it is safe to just jump right in).</p>

<p>I'm not actually convinced splitting out the "add users" is a good idea, now that I think about it more and see how other products do it. I think a better strategy might be to just simplify all the fields enough that it fits nicely in one screen</p>

<p>E.g. we don't need all the words for both Public and Private (we could show just the one you've selected), our box for stream description could be one line instead of two since we actually only want small descriptions, and instead of People to Add it could be just a single input box that took either stream names or people names (or a mix), and added the union of them.</p>
