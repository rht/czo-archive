<p>Should the user search in the right sidebar filter group PMs as well? Currently there's no easy way to browse the group PMs you have that include a given user.</p>

<p>Possibly.  I think the UI would be  more intuitive if it had its own search bar.  I wonder how common it is for folks to have more than 2 or 3 entries there.  I currently have one.</p>

<p>I currently have 8. I think it'll be even more in realms where users are not allowed to create streams, or in orgs that are naturally less streams-heavy (e.g. HR).</p>

<p>I'm still in the camp that we want to eliminate group PMs from the right sidebar and instead show presence indicators under "Private messages" on the left.  (The main rationale for that is real estate, but there are also subtle reasons like buddy list isn't really about prior conversations.)</p>
<p>Realistically, I think it's here to stay, but I'd still be disinclined to add more features to it.  For finding prior conversations, I think the more valuable path is to have dedicated UI for recent conversations that's at the granularity of conversation, not message.  (You can do group-pm-with searches now, but they don't have a nice summary.)</p>
