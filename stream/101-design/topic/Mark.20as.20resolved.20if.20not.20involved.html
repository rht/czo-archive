<p>It seems like there are a reasonably large number of times that a user clicks the <span aria-label="check" class="emoji emoji-2705" role="img" title="check">:check:</span> icon accidentally -- either because they are new and don't know that it affects everyone's state (like the <span aria-label="pencil" class="emoji emoji-270f" role="img" title="pencil">:pencil:</span> but unlike the <span aria-label="bell" class="emoji emoji-1f514" role="img" title="bell">:bell:</span>), or because they missed one of the adjacent icons, or were just trying to click the whole topic bar to narrow.</p>
<p>Could we have an interstitial confirmation dialog if the user isn't following and hasn't corresponded in the topic?  Since a small amount more friction for the uncommon case of someone dropping in to clean up a topic they didn't participate in seems worth saving the "completed, uncompleted, 'sorry mis-clicked'" dance, and would also help educate users the first time they do it.</p>

<p>Hmm, I think there's a lot of use cases where such a thing would be annoying -- like if you're clicking to resolve a bunch of threads created by automation.</p>

<p>But I think it would be very reasonable for it to be a first-time popup of some sort -- I bet in ~80% of cases where we see this in <a href="http://chat.zulip.org">chat.zulip.org</a>, the core issue is that the user doesn't know that "mark as resolved" is a global thing, not some variant of "mark as read".</p>

<p>That may also point to the resolve icon being in the wrong place, or not well enough labeled.</p>
<p>I feel like mixing global and user-local things in the topic bar may be a step in the wrong direction here, in terms of adding the follow icon there.</p>

<p>We could also predicate the popup on not being an admin / moderator or something.  But that's starting to get to be a complicated heuristic.</p>

<p>We can use the Hotspots data tables for it -- there's an unfinished PR to rename it to a more generic onboarding steps system, but we've yet to have a reason to actually do that refactor.</p>

<p>Would "Mark topic as resolved" be a bit more clear than "Mark as resolved"? It seems more consistent with our other menu items.</p>

<p>I don't know if that would help users realize it's changing the topic rather than changing their own view, but it's possible it might? Not sure.</p>

<p>I wonder if the confusion comes from the word “Mark.” We’ve already got “Mark as read” in the UI, and that’s a very personal, you-only action. Would something like “Resolve topic for all users” be an improvement, or at least a different phrase to iterate on?</p>

<p>Perhaps.  The bell icon already has significantly more text in its tippy tooltip, so we could also add an italicized explanatory second line.</p>

<p>In the left sidebar 3-dot menu, we have a divider between personal actions and global actions. I wonder if we should in the topic header bar as well?</p>
