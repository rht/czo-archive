<p>I just came back to the chat and had over 100 missed message. I usually don't mute topics (due to my laziness) but just skim through home to catch up. So I thought an alternative home view might be useful that groups all the topics together in home with an indication how many messages in it I have missed and marks topics that mention me in red or uncollapses that particular message. <br>
It would look something like this and would be a more effective summary. <br>

<p>of course the numbers of missed messages don't add up in the 'screenshot'</p>

<p>I would find this extremely useful.  We've discussed doing this as part of a popup through some hotkey and/or menu option.</p>

<p>how would the popup work? like a general home but just with stream &gt; topic headers chronologically sorted?</p>

<p>I am slightly mixing up concepts here, but we've talked about having a list of recent narrows in a popup, but I could also see a popup that looks a lot like your image above that shows recent topics, and you could narrow to them as needed.</p>

<p>I think it'd be a cool option to add; we could call it "unread messages" in the top-left area.</p>

<p>unread messsages would be good. I've heard feedback in our company that some start up zulip and immediately end up in the home narrow which marks msgs as read straight away. But the user might still be busy looking out Outlook mails or something else that came up. They often miss those msg that zulip marked read too quickly. Maybe Zulip should start marking as read with the first scroll action (oups, different topic.)<br>
but unread msgs could really help - esp when concise as above</p>

<p>The home narrow will only mark messages as read if you can see the bottom of the feed, i.e. there's &lt;5 of them.<br>
Check with those users for whether they're using the  "Always auto-scroll to new messages" Zulip Labs setting</p>

<p>FYI: how I use the browser to catch up on many missed messages right now</p>
<ul>
<li>scroll down the home</li>
<li>if I see a message or topic I want to narrow to I press Ctrl + left mouse to open the topic in a new browser tab</li>
<li>when down with reading I close this tab with Ctrl + W which returns me to Zulip home narrow tab</li>
<li>continue until I'm done</li>
</ul>
<p>every time I close a topic tab the main home tab updates the missed msgs as well which is nice</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-email="m.mueller@intercultural-elements.eu" data-user-id="1646">@Matthias Müller</span> can you open an issue based around that screenshot?  I think for now, we can describe it as an "unread messages" view that would go between "Private messages" and "starred messages".  I want to put it on the list of ideas for the PyCon sprints :)</p>
