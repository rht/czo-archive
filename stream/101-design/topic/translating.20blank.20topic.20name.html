<p>Hey folks! <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="22433">Vlad Korobov</span> , <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="7">Tim Abbott</span> and I did some brainstorming on the default topic yesterday, and how one might be able to internationalize it. As a reminder, <code>(no topic)</code> is not internationalized currently because of the complexity of what happens when different users in an organization use different languages. (And even the organization's default language might occasionally change.)</p>
<p>The idea that came up is that perhaps we could take the following approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>The default topic is encoded as blank string on the server side.</li>
<li>The server tells clients what name to use for the topic (e.g., "general chat" or "chatter" (see <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="101" href="/#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/Renaming.20.28no.20topic.29">#design &gt; Renaming (no topic)</a> ), but it would be relatively easy to change if we need to).</li>
<li>Clients display the default topic name with special decoration, perhaps italics.</li>
<li>Sending a message to general chat" is <em>different</em> from sending to the special topic. So, you could have both "general chat" and "<em>general chat</em>" in the left sidebar, for instance.</li>
<li>Since server-side the topic is always empty, the display name could be internationalized and shown in the user's language.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the clients, we'd also have to make sure we do something reasonable in message notification emails and push notifications.</p>
<p>Thoughts? CC <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="2187">@Greg Price</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="2406">@Neil Pilgrim (neiljp)</span></p>

<p>There is currently no internationalization in ZT, so we would likely add it after this was adjusted.</p>

<p>I understand the benefit of internationalizing it, but if the name could be apparently duplicated to users in some languages then it feels like it should be separated or styled <em>very</em> clearly from other topics - which isn't like now, or how I expect would be desired?</p>
<p>If two topics named <code>general chat</code> exist, I could expect one user may try and rename the empty-topic one to the other (ie. combine them), and the no-topic translation would be lost... or would it? The messages would move, presumably, but would the empty-topic be conceptually present with no messages? If another user was messaging to blank, it would certainly look buggy in that regard.</p>
<p>I'd also be concerned that in an internationalized context, if someone feels the name is inaccurate and wants to rename it to be more accurate more generally, doing so by a standard topic rename would leave it non-internationalized and confuse other users using a different language: their internationalized 'general chat' is now a specifically-named topic in a particular language. I'd need to test, but don't recall there's a way to put messages back into an empty topic?</p>

<p>No, if a user sends a message with a blank topic, it's gets recorded as "(no topic)" on the server. Messages where the user puts "(no topic)" in the topic field go to the same place.</p>

<p>If the blank topic has no messages, we could decide what to do, but we probably wouldn't show it, no. We might initiate that topic with a bot message when a stream is created, but it would eventually end up low in the list if it's not being used.</p>

<p>Mm, good point, we may want to change some aspects of the UI there. Maybe we should remove the pencil icon, and perhaps some of the topic menu options as well. While you may want to move messages out of the topic, conceptually, you can't really rename or move the topic itself.</p>

<p>We'd probably want to move messages in "(no topic)" to the blank topic when doing the migration. People could of course still send messages to "(no topic)", but it wouldn't have any special meaning anymore.</p>

<p>While that migration seems important to do, to achieve this result, could we use something to avoid this behaving strangely with older clients? For example, support the old behavior translating to empty topics based on some client-capability?</p>

<p>This sounds like a reasonable UX design to me.</p>
<p>There are questions we should figure out about exactly how this is represented in the API, which we should have a thread in <a class="stream" data-stream-id="378" href="/#narrow/stream/378-api-design">#api design</a> about. In particular we'll want to take care with that to keep the experience reasonable on existing clients. I think the server will need to continue to treat the topic string "(no topic)" specially, at least when dealing with existing clients.</p>

<p>Depending on exactly how we handle that, this might also mean that if a user on a new client moves some messages, and for the new topic they type out the actual string "(no topic)", they'll see the messages appear instead at "general chat" or whatever.</p>
<p>That'd be a bit quirky but I think would be fine in practice. The string "(no topic)" is not something one would naturally try to use as a topic name, so it's unlikely anyone will actually see that behavior unless they're specifically trying to exercise quirks in Zulip's "no-topic topic" concept.</p>

<p>This all sounds like a huge amount of complexity for minimal benefit—the edge case of an edge case where a user with a language different from the organization language wants to see a single topic name, that we don’t even encourage using, translated in a way that’s not consistent with every other topic and every message?</p>

<p>Yeah, I was imagining that having topics that happen to have the same name in the left sidebar or in search results is not a big deal. We'll have styling that hints at what's going on, and it would not come up very often. So <code>(no topic)</code> is the only one I was imagining we'd touch as part of the migration process.</p>

<p>Let's worry about the transition issues around <code>"(no topic)"</code> once we've figured out what we want the eventual experience to be. I agree they may be complicated, with the simplest options likely involving a migration to move every message that was previously in "no topic" (and maybe trying to do something to avoid that breaking links).</p>

<p>Yeah, that's my thinking. Special-casing specific topic names that differ between different users is a path to madness, for the reasons Anders pointed out -- you end up with an ever-expanding set of topic names that need to be special because they're a translation of the special topic into another language. </p>
<p>The only escape from that class of problem that I see is for the empty string to be the only special topic -- because that is the same in every language. The italics display proposal above is an attempt to solve the problem of "How do we display and talk about the empty string topic / topicless messages in navigation UI".</p>

<p>So the way I think about this proposal is to replace <code>(no topic)</code> with the empty string, and then figure out a way to display the empty string in clients that isn't in the same visual space as the topic whose name is whatever we use to display it (italics being the specific proposal to achieve that).</p>

<ul>
<li>Considering any translation interop with ZT - but ZT is not internationalized, so...</li>
<li>Then broader potential usage issues; these were from an international perspective, since that was the topic, but some apply simply from the complexity of changing from <code>(no topic)</code> to another name (so could have gone in the other topic)</li>

<p>I think as long as the typeahead makes it hard to select "general chat" as your topic (by having the first option be the empty topic), probably that sort of collision won't come up except for folks trying to break the app, so it wouldn't be a significant source of confusion.</p>

<p>It's correct that we don't localize the search operators like <code>stream:</code>, yes.

<p>For email notifications, he point is that this is a case where the solution discussed above of using italics styling to keep the blank topic that is displayed as "general chat"  separate from the topic that is called "general chat" (Spelled in the user's language) can't be used in email notifications, since we can't style the topic in the subject line there.</p>
<p>If we thought that a problem important enough to solve, we could consider doing a subject line like "general chat in #streamname" or "#streamname general chat", rather than "#streamname &gt; general chat", as an alternative way to break out of the namespace of actual topic names.</p>

<p>OK, let me try to list out the places where this comes up with proposed solutions, and we can see how we feel about it.</p>
<h2>Matching behavior for searches, filters and typeaheads</h2>
<ul>
<li>Before there is input, show at the top of the typeahead suggestions with special styling (italics)</li>
<li>Always use the localized string</li>
<li>Matches as if it were the translated "general chat" string in the user's language.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compose box topic</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The are 2 ways to compose to chatter (empty topic): 1. select it among the topics 2. click new topic button and don't write anything to it or remove the topic with a cursor</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There will be special styling (italics) in the typeahead and the topic box itself.</p>
<h2>Stream &gt; topic mentions (like <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="101" href="/#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/translating.20blank.20topic.20name">#design &gt; translating blank topic name</a> )</h2>

<p>I'd like to propose something that might simplify some of the complexity here: </p>
<p>What if the default topic name was be the same across an organization (but would be translated to the default language of the organization).</p>
<p>Reasoning: Other topic names aren’t translated, so it seems reasonable for this one to be in whatever language is spoken by the users sharing that topic. (maybe we would allow it to be renamed by administrators on a per stream basis?)</p>
<p>This would let us more easily prevent a topic from having the same name as the default topic, which would make it easier to reference this topic name in various places and <em>would help us support old clients that don’t know the difference between the special default topic and other topics</em></p>
<ul>
<li>It would be implemented as one blacklisted topic name per org (or stream)</li>
<li>When admins choose or confirm the default topic name, they can also make an explicit choice about what to do with any topic that already has that name</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="21453">@Evy</span> the reason we proposed <code>""</code> for this purpose is that the default language for the organization is mutable, and it feels like we'll have to do something quite ugly in order to implement changing the value of the default topic.</p>

<p>I think there's some annoying backwards-compatibility work needed to have older clients do something reasonable with it, but I think it' s a cleaner long-term model for changing the value of an organization setting to not require moving a topic in every single stream. (Presumably, we could automate it rather than making the user do it, but it still seems super messy).</p>

<p>To be clear, I'm not talking about storing it as those strings attached to the message. The topic would be referred to with the empty string on messages, and the name the server replaces it with would be decided by the organization settings.</p>

<p>I'm talking about how to handle the UI problem where the default topic can have the same name as another topic, and I think that everyone in the org seeing the same default topic name string simplifies this a lot.</p>

<p>The organization language can be changed but it isn’t going to be changed regularly. When it is changed, do we really want to automatically break historical references to the old topic name?</p>

<p>I think it should take the name of the initial language, and probably be allowed to be changed if the new name isn't taken by any existing topics</p>

<p>Yeah, that's the type of weird issue that makes me prefer a fixed encoding for the blank topic name on the wire/API; and if we have some display sugar for it, that sugar should just be in the UI, and not ever be stored somewhere.</p>

<p>Well the idea, which we've not fully thought through, was to have <em>general chat</em> (italics) or some other styled thing be the name for the special topic. But yeah I'm not sure what will feel right; we should think about it more when we have the attention to push through the overall change (there's a lot of migration complexity no matter which option we pick).</p>

<p>I understand that's the idea, but it creates complexity for things like the dropdown and typing links to topics, which the idea I suggested wouldn't have.</p>
