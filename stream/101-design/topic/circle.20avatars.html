<p>the decision about form of the user pick is a key here <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="19257">@Alya Abbott</span> <br>
I think that circle is forcing people to use more appropriate user pics and user pic shouldn't be something as a solid picture.<br>
Circle user pic is almost a standard these days (gmail, instagram, messengers).</p>
<p>Here is the example of the transition: <a href="/user_uploads/2/e/8MqCFaEHSKZMexcqBpva-C4v/image.png">square</a><br>
Nothing important is lost: <a href="/user_uploads/2/f/VhcgP0pg7Iinp80GVeWaD3Nm/image.png">circle</a></p>

<p>I agree that circular avatars are cool right now, but I don't think we want to switch to circular avatars.  Circular avatars often look bad if you're doing images that are not headshot photos.  Which include the logos of many organizations (E.g. we generally recommend folks use the GitHub logo for their bot, and plan to have that be setup for you automatically.  Not every organization had a nice looking logo with circular cropping).</p>
<p>Circular avatars also waste space when you have a limited square region of screen real estate allocated to a picture.</p>

<p>I think Vlad is saying that can be a good thing; see his screenshot <a href="#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/circle.20avatars/near/1327770">above</a>. Do we hope to guide people toward using headshot photos?</p>
<p>(I personally don't really have an opinion about circle vs. rounded square.)</p>

<p>I think it really varies by use case whether pressuring folks to use zoomed headshot photos is what you want.  I know there are people who like to use a given image they drew as part of their handle online, for example.</p>

<p>Yes the idea was that.</p>

<p>I guess organizations are already using circular logo on twitter, facebook, instagram</p>

<p>I wouldn't say its a waste, but intentional not usage of that space.</p>
<p>Anyway I just tried it out, since in a different thread avatars of people were circular for the right panel with statuses.<br>
I'm for consistency. Lets decide which kind we use and will use that form everywhere.</p>

<p>If we did circles, we'd also need to do a different default avatar than gravatar, since gravatar's default avatars look like crap if you crop them to a circle. Which would also mean I'd need to re-learn probably dozens of avatar to person associations all at once, which I'm not excited at the prospect of.</p>

<p>I'm personally not a fan of circles in general — they still seem like trend-chasing to me, even, uh, a solid decade after they started popping up everywhere — but IMO gravatar is the main reason it seems like a bad idea to me.</p>

<p>I also think circle avatars are <a href="https://www.are.na/wesleyac/fuck-circle-avatars-all-my-homies-use-squares">very likely to annoy people</a>, whereas I don't see many people annoyed at square avatars. People do say that the Zulip UI looks dated, and circles are associated with modernity, but I don't think that changing to circles is likely to result in a significant reduction in the number of people who think the Zulip UI looks dated, relative to other UI/UX improvements that seem completely uncontroversial.</p>

<p>It is the same crap as if square. I'm ok with any form of Avatar but gravatar in future should be replaced with something els... just initials of the name works better.</p>

<p>my thoughts on this:</p>
<ul>
<li>circle avatar does look more modern, though possibly not enough to outweigh the disadvantages of cutting off pictures</li>
<li>gravatars (imo) look dated moreso than than square avatars -- I think changing this would be more impactful than moving to circle avatars</li>
<li>either of those changes are risky because avatars are one of the most "this is my identity" things on people's profile, and changing something close to someone's online identity seems more likely to bring up strong feelings</li>
</ul>

<p>I think we're planning to replace gravatar regardless, but it remains the case that circular avatars would substantially limit the design space of procedurally generated avatars. Also worth noting this would be a change one would need to coordinate with the mobile apps, and thus a lot more technically complex than it would seem.  I would prefer to focus our attention on other design directions where it's easier to get a clear improvement for a smaller amount of work.</p>

<p>Basically just write our own procedural generator, ideally one which can be implemented entirely in JavaScript so that we don't need to send such avatars over the network to clients (especially on mobile).

<p>I don't think name initials are a great option; we need to support a wide range of number of words in names (1-4 are common, it can be weird with internationalization, etc.), and that ends up being a lot of design work.  One would be better off with the Discord strategy of having everyone have the same avatar icon who hasn't uploaded one than doing that, I think.  </p>
<p>We do have the option of offering more than one option, but I would prefer to just make one thing that's good first.</p>

<p>This is kinda a hard problem if you want to prioritize privacy. With Gravatar, the model is that it contains a hash of your email address, and thus fundamentally if you can see someone's Gravatar, you can brute force your email address. The simplest models for doing this sort of thing would be to make the avatar be a function of something like a <code>(server_uri, user_id)</code> pair, or perhaps a <code>realm_uuid, user_id</code> pair (if we want it to be stable across domain changes), and that of course won't follow you to other hosting.</p>
<p>Gravatar's origin is as a way to have the same avatar across a bunch of Wordpress blogs all over the Internet, and was created with that design constraint.</p>

<p>If we want our procedurally avatars to be stable across different Zulip Cloud orgs, we'd need to make it a function of something stable in that way, which basically has to be your email address, which we don't want to be sharing with all users in every Zulip Cloud organization. But I think that'd be basically a pointless feature: What you want is an avatar you uploaded to be used everywhere, not a procedurally generated one.</p>

<p>And the whole thing we're discussing is what happens if you don't bother to upload one.  (If we wanted to be able to upload your avatar just once for all of Zulip Cloud, we'd be looking at a very different implementation direction)</p>

<p>Right, I should also add that for Zulip Cloud some specific details that probably not everyone here knows:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you create a second account with the same email address, you're offered the opportunity to import your avatar from any existing Zulip Cloud organization. This has been true for 2-3 years. (It also will import most other personal preference settings). The thing that isn't great today is that if you decide to change your avatar, you have to upload it in each organization, which is annoying, but for a relatively infrequent task. This is a consequence of our decision to have accounts be per-organization, which is good for the security of corporate users (E.g. you can require SAML authentication to login to a specific organization) but results in this sort of inconvenience for non-corporate organizations.</li>
<li>There's no simple way to share Zulip Cloud avatars with self-hosted organizations without some sort of security/privacy consequences. But it would be possible in a future OAuth world.</li>
</ul>

<p>Such a sync feature would reasonably complex, in part because it violates the existing security model.  I think if we want to work on the general issue, more important might be adjusting marketing/documentation so that users know that the existing feature exists.</p>
