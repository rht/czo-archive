<p>Presently, streams are ordered in alphabetical order. How about arranging them in the order of one's activity level?  Most frequently visited would always be on top. Your views?</p>

<p>There's some complexity involved here, there have been a few discussions about rearranging the stream names in the left side bar, over all I believe alphabetic was decided upon for simplicity and uniformity, you can probably find the conversations if you search through the issue tracker on github.</p>

<p>One challenge with sorting by activity is that it makes finding a specific stream much harder, since your eyes can't scan efficiently.</p>

<p>So if we supported that, we'd do it as an easily toggled option.</p>

<p>Hello to all.<br>
Presently, streams are ordered in alphabetical order. <br>
Is it possible to make channels with activity on top?<br>
So that when the stream receives a message, he rises higher.<br>
Thanks</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="13295">@Ivan Mihalevich</span> Have you tried out our Recent Topics feature?  That might address part of your concerns.  You can use the hotkey "t" to launch it.</p>

<p>It was added recently on the master branch, and it's been deployed here, but it hasn't been released yet.  We intend to release it in the next version.</p>
