<p>I tried to find an image I recently uploaded. The <a href="https://chat.zulip.org/#settings/uploaded-files" target="_blank" title="https://chat.zulip.org/#settings/uploaded-files">Uploaded files</a> list didn't seem to have any obvious initial sorting. It wasn't until I stumbled over <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/6747" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/6747">this</a> PR that I realized clicking on one of the fields would sort the files accordingly. This was because hovering over the fields didn't give me any visual feedback that these are clickable. </p>
<p>I suggest</p>
<ul>
<li>initially sort all files by date</li>
<li>make the info titles more button-ish. Provide a visual feedback on hovering and clicking.</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to create an issue here.  I'm actually kind of surprised it looks as nice as it does, since I don't think we've ever given this UI a ton of attention.  But it could use a bit more polish.</p>
