<p>This may be intentional, but the participants (list/icons) shown in Recent conversations include at least myself, even if I've not sent a message to that PM-conversation, which is not the case for topics?</p>

<p>It looks like the <code>recent_senders</code> module doesn't currently track the data of which users have sent messages in private message conversations, so it'd be a nontrivial project to fix.</p>

<p>We use that module also for things like contextual typeahead sorting, but we don't need to track it for a private message context, since the set of users in the conversation is known and small.</p>

<p>I think I've run into that behavior and it felt pretty buggy. It's giving me untruthful information -- it's telling me that so-and-so was the one who sent that last message I haven't seen yet, but in reality it was someone else.</p>

<p>Dropping the participants seems a bit confusing (does it somehow imply that there are no participants?), but less confusing than showing data that breaks the general paradigm.</p>

<p>One downside of removing the participants section for private messages would be that you can't click on the avatars to get more information about those users. Probably not a big deal, and of course something that would be fixed with this long term plan anyway.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think that's fine. You can always click through to the conversation, and then click on either a sender avatar (for anyone in the conversation who's sent a message recently) or use the "Private messages" section of the left sidebar.</p>

<p>I'm feeling a bit reluctant about integrating that this close to the 6.0 release, mainly because it feels like a somewhat risky UI change. A few notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>That screenshot has all the private messages at the top, but interleaved I think it'll just feel buggy/visually choppy to have that column be empty sometimes with no apparent explanation.</li>
<li>The column at present does provide useful information -- I used it to quickly find a thread with a specific pair of other people without having to read. There's probably another solution, but the avatars of the other users in a PM thread are useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't like that the definition we have is "For stream messages: The set of users who have recently sent a message, sorted by recency; for private messages: The set of users who received the message in random order." But I also am not convinced this local tweak to avoid that is actually an improvement; it might be better to just do the work to be able to sort correctly. (Though it may still be useful to show all the avatars even for users who haven't sent a message? Idunno). </p>
<p>Since we don't have time to iterate on this on <a href="http://chat.zulip.org">chat.zulip.org</a>, and it's I think a fairly minor/subtle issue, I think we should just plan to address this after 6.0.</p>

<p>It's your call, but FWIW I disagree.</p>
<p>The existing behavior is flatly buggy: it lies to the user.</p>
<p>I've been puzzled several times by it. I regularly look at the "participants" column to see who the author was, or authors were, of the unread messages in a conversation when I've previously participated in the conversation and recognize it. I spot my avatar, and then the avatars found to the left are people who've said things since I last replied there.</p>

<p>Several times, I've had new messages come into a PM conversation, looked over at the "participants" column, and thought:</p>
<ul>
<li>"hmm, wait, how can there be two new senders when there's only one unread? I sure thought I'd sent a reply the last time I looked at that thread…"</li>
<li>"hmm, wait, how are there <em>no</em> new senders when there's supposedly an unread?"</li>

<p>I regret that I didn't report the bug earlier. I knew that the PM rows in Recent Conversations were new, it felt like they were rapidly changing and unstable, and I figured that such obviously-broken behavior was something that would get fixed among the people working on the feature before it was considered ready.</p>

<p>That's helpful context on the trade-off between the options. </p>
<p>I think regardless of what we do for tomorrow, we should plan to backport a change to just add a data structure in <code>recent_senders.js</code> to support displaying the exact same definition of participants we display for other items.</p>

<p>I browsed through Recent Conversations with this deployed, and it looked good to me!</p>

<p>I also filed A<strong>dd participants info for PMs in Recent conversations</strong> <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/23563">#23563</a> for the long-term fix. Currently not marked as high-priority, though maybe it should be? Probably depends on how hard it is.</p>
<p>Definitely not a release goal, in any case.</p>

<p>I think it's not hard; it's a fairly straightforward data structure to just record for each (conversation, sender) pair the lowest known message ID with taht sender.</p>

<p>I think there's a couple follow-ups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there documentation we should add to the "Recent conversations" /help/ page explaining how this works? I think basically "Everything in recent conversations is based on what history is cached in your browser; participants displays users who have sent messages in that conversation in your browser's cached history ordered by how recently their most recent message was."</li>
<li>Once we've settled that, we can decide if we want to backport this to 6.1/6.2.</li>

<p>Err, can we avoid talking about browser caches in user-facing documentation, please? What would we wrong with just explaining that the "Participants" column has the most recent users who've sent messages in the conversation, newest on the left?</p>

<p>Because anything that doesn't hint about that is inaccurate, and it's not easy to change the implementation to be accurate (Though it is a goal for 7.0). See <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="6" href="/#narrow/stream/6-frontend/topic/fetching.20message.20history">#frontend &gt; fetching message history</a> for the large project that we need to do at some point if we want to change this definition to something understandable.</p>
<p>In particular, if a user last sent a message in a topic 6 weeks ago, "Participants" will likely not include that user (the same is true for the "Participated" filter). I suppose one class of thing we could do that'd be easy is to have "Recent conversations" display how far back its knowledge goes, with a button to fetch more.</p>

<p>Anything appearing in "Recent conversations" will have at least one recent participant, because of how it's built. The exception might be if the only recent participants are users you've muted; I'm not sure how that interaction works.</p>

<p>Yeah, I didn't meant we should use those words, just that we needed to be careful because the naive thing to say here (that it's "all participants") is not true; not that we need to use those particular words. Was in a hurry to note that we likely need some follow-ups between other tasks, and not trying to draft language.</p>
