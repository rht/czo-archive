<p>Hey guys just want some feedbacks over this .Previously we are facing the problem of proper model of display setting.Now few things i have changed them out.:<br>
1.Made them appear as different sections.(language has its own and others too).<br>
2.We can get rid of this suggested for you option as it automatically populated by the OS.<br>
3.Added a filter option there so that manually we can add the zone.<br>
4.Used cap letters to stand out more in headings.<br>
5.A dropdown button more clear to let user comfortable<br>
Now we can also think of "default language" model of something like without list box having plus button to add something like this?<br>
If you have something in your mind then do mention.<br>

<p>Yeah <span class="user-mention" data-user-email="yo@vishnuks.com" data-user-id="52">@Vishnu Ks</span> , Previously I thought to put the suggested for you section there so people can get automatic time zone by the OS below it, but after feedback, I got to know that "suggest for you" text is not necessary we can have our automatic time zone at the top populated by the OS diretly. In short forgot about "Suggest for you" text.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-email="yo@vishnuks.com" data-user-id="52">@Vishnu Ks</span> The OS has a default time zone.  Zulip has chosen to have its own time zone, rather than automatically using what the OS has.  I think the main reason for this is that sometimes you want to change your OS timezone, so that the clock works, but you still want to appear to Zulip people to be in your "home" timezone.  My email client is like Zulip--it has its own concept of timezone.  But it detects when the browser is different than it, and it nags me to change it.</p>

<p>I remember that we store the value of timezone which is displayed in that particular field when user sign up for the first time. We do this with the help of <code>moment.tz.guess()</code>  So there are two sets of users who can make use of <strong>suggested timezone</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The users who have signed up before the timezone feature got merged and has not yet set up their timezone.</li>
<li>The users who moved to another timezone after signing up.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can populate the suggested timezone with help of <code>moment.tz.guess()</code> if the timezone value is not set or is different from the guess function. Did I got that correct?</p>

<p>Arguably, we should just automatically set your time zone to be the time zone your currently active client is in.  Though I guess that might get weird if your phone and desktop computer are in different time zones...</p>

<p>OK; at least one web, we display messages using the time zone of the current browser/device.  But if you're using the timezone field on mobile, I think that only gets set on account creation and when the user changes their settings, so if they signed up while in UTC+3, that could explain it.</p>

<p>Hey! Following up on the usability testing <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="58">@Steve Howell (showell)</span> and I did and thoughts Steve posted in <a class="stream" data-stream-id="65" href="/#narrow/stream/65-checkins">#checkins</a> , I have a proposal for rearranging the Display Settings panel.</p>
<p>Currently, it's not easy to find the most relevant settings at a glance, as they are interspersed with a lot of settings that are only relevant once you've been using Zulip for some time and have an idea of what you want to work differently. So I was thinking we could reshuffle things along the following lines:</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Basic settings</strong> <em>(not sure if there's a better name for this?)</em><br>
Language <em>(renamed from "Default language")</em><br>
Time format</p>
<p><strong>Theme</strong> <br>
Color scheme<br>
[emoji theme picker]</p>
<p>[ ]  Convert emoticons before sending (<code>:)</code> becomes <span aria-label="smiley" class="emoji emoji-1f603" role="img" title="smiley">:smiley:</span>)</p>
<p><strong>Advanced settings</strong><br>
Default view <br>
Demote inactive streams <br>
[ ] Show user list on left sidebar in narrow windows<br>
[ ] Use full width on wide screens<br>
[ ] Show counts for starred messages </p>
<hr>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>I think I agree with all the changes there except I'd prefer a label like "Language and time" rather than "Basic settings" for that first section.</p>

<p>I'd be happy with that.</p>

<p>Is anyone else worried that it might be hard for a user who doesn’t read the default language to find the language setting?</p>

<p>I think we used to have it on the first settings pane, but now it’s on the third.</p>

<p>I agree that is a potential concern. I think this proposed change doesn't make it any better or worse, as it'll still be at the top of this pane.</p>

<p>Separately: I think the color scheme is probably much more common for people to want to change than the time format.</p>

<p>Yeah, my original thought was to have a "Basic settings" section that would include the color scheme (above the time format), followed by an "Emoji theme" section. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="7">@Tim Abbott</span>  suggested grouping the theme settings together, which does seem nice.</p>

<p>I don't think it's ever been on the first settings pane.  But our goal in general should be to handle that problem via the signup form.</p>

<p>I checked on Zulip Cloud, and 4x as many users have changed their time format as have changed their color scheme from the "Automatic" (aka detect from the OS/browser configuration) default.  They are both some of our very most popular settings to toggle.</p>
