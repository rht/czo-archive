<p>This made me have an idea, see, in my editor (VSC), I can press <code>ctrl</code> + <code>p</code> which brings up a small text box at the top, followed by <code>&gt;</code> and then I can type a command I want VSC to execute.<br>
So, on zulip, if I press <code>ctrl</code> + <code>shift</code> + <code>z</code> it'd be cool to open a box that can accept the /command and suggests available commands through the typeahead.<br>
If we don't want to have a separate text box, we can also try and modify the search bar to accept commands (equivalent to the <code>&gt;</code> in VSC) and allow the user to put stuff in there.</p>

<p>I think just sticking with the current / typeahead is fine for now, to be honest.  It's not clear to me why we don't support "/day" and "/night" there (at least based on what I just tried in the compose box).  Probably an easy fix to do first.</p>

<p>Since this conversation got bumped...</p>
<p>I think what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="58">@Steve Howell</span> proposes is a relic of the IRC era, slash commands, and in my view they are confusing and have the likelihood of accidentally sending a message to a stream when you don't intend to do that. Say, you wanna switch to the night mode but accidentally type <code>\night</code> or <code>.night</code> instead. That would get send to whatever conversation you're in.</p>

<p>In other words, I don't like the idea that something that's not meant to be sent as a message is tied to the compose-box. These should be separate concepts, especially now since we do not have the limitations of IRC and the like that resulted in the slash-commands system in the first place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They call it the Command palette, I believe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right, and to be clear I was saying we could either add our own command pallet or just shift command execution from the compose box to the search box. (I imagine a really nice interaction when you couple this with the new navbar, a high efficiency feature that other apps don't provide).</p>

<p>It's worth listing all the commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>/me - clearly messaging-related</li>
<li>/poll, /todo - makes the most sense in the compose box, because you're addressing the poll to a particular stream or PM group, plus you can type the title and options right there</li>
<li>/tictactoe - for this and other future toys we build, the compose box makes sense since the game gets embedded in a message</li>
<li>/day, /night, /light, /dark - really have nothing to do with the compose box (and can be set in settings)</li>
<li>/ping - not super important, it's just a way to test slash commands, but I'd keep it in the compose box</li>
</ul>
<p>Given that only really day/night make sense out of the compose box, and we already have a way to do the relevant actions via the settings menu, I'm not sure how much value another UI would add here.</p>

<p>I actually do support building some kind of command pallet, but I think that's mostly orthogonal to the slash commands.  If we have a bunch of useful commands that we want to have handy at the press of a key, and for which there's not an already logical place to put them (e.g. sidebar menus, message menus, etc.), then we should make a little pallet menu.  But we should first enumerate what those tasks are.</p>

<p>(We may soon have a "/full" slash command as well, to add to the list above.  It's in the same category as the day/night stuff.)</p>

<p>For me a command menu would mostly include things you can do with hotkeys.  Instead of having to memorize q, w, n, and p, I'd want a menu like this that I could navigate with error keys:</p>
<ul>
<li>toggle to night mode</li>
<li>go to next unread topic (n)</li>
<li>go to next unread PMs (p)</li>
<li>search streams (q)</li>
<li>search users (w)</li>
<li>start poll (/poll)</li>
<li>view messages sent by me</li>
</ul>

<p>And the idea here is that the command pallet would also reinforce the hotkeys and other UI idioms, so as I get more advanced, I'll just start hitting "n" directly or just type "/poll" directly into the compose box.</p>

<p>I really like the idea of having a command palette in addition to everything else. And if we add it, then removing the /day and /night slash commands.</p>

<p>Yes, please.  I really don't like the idea of cluttering search more than we already do.  There are also lots of users (myself included) who rarely use it for anything other than either traditional keyword search or strange, advanced searches.  It's not part of my normal workflow--I'd much rather pop up a modal for all these handy commands.</p>
