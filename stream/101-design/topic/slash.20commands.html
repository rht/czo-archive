<p>We could obviously extend the capability of slash commands.  We don't have a great customer feedback loop on this.  I know that I personally use "/me" (albeit mostly for silly reasons), "/poll" (for fairly practical reasons), and "/day" and "/night" (but often for dev-related reasons).</p>

<p>Out typeahead support has gotten more complete since March of last year: <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/master/static/js/composebox_typeahead.js#L356">https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/master/static/js/composebox_typeahead.js#L356</a></p>
<p>For example, we now support "/fluid-width" and "/fixed-width" in the typeahead.  It should be a pretty easy PR to add "/settings" to the typeahead.</p>

<p>It's a little unfortunate that "/me" and "/poll" are no longer in the top five options, since I think they are probably two of the more popular commands.  And we only show 5 things in the typeahead, which is a bit of a pet peeve of mine (especially when completing common names like "Tim").</p>

<p>I suspect I have less customer interaction so can't comment with as much context, but other platforms certainly seem to run with these ideas, whether it's coming from IRC or where maybe even integrations are managed that way?

<p>I know there's an ease of use aspect here, but I'd also personally prefer more namespacing of them too - while <code>/dark</code> and friends are zcommands and so could be completely different in a different client in any case, in ZT I imagine we'd choose <code>/theme &lt;name&gt;</code>. Perhaps similarly for the width commands.</p>

<p>The “framework” is in place to add slash commands.  And I put framework in quotes, because it’s basically not much code at all.</p>
<p>There are probably some ambitious things we can do related to integrations that might require some non-trivial infrastructure or custom code, but for things that are basically UI shortcuts, patches should be about 15-30 lines including tests.</p>

<p>It might just be similar to your point about showing only 5 things in typeahead, so showing 'category' commands (<code>/theme</code>) vs individual command (4x as many) would alleviate that. Of course, there's then a concern over how/whether to autocomplete the parameters, but <code>/theme</code> could give a message listing available options, for example. That said, I'm familiar how important dark mode is these days ;)</p>

<p>Parameters to it appear to be ignored right now, but this could allow <code>/settings fullname My New Name</code>, for example. I understand that's again on the edge of making name-changing too easy.</p>

<p>That version sounds great to me, actually. I share the concerns about <code>/nick</code> potentially encouraging a cultural norm of "nickname" identifiers -- particularly for people coming from IRC. But I think <code>/settings fullname My New Name</code> should avoid that problem pretty well.</p>

<p>They all work with <code>/theme</code> with that commit. If using that approach, the question would be whether to have that as the base to point people at (with typeahead) and have the other slash commands still work but not shown in typeahead, though possibly still hinted when used?</p>

<p>If I wanted day mode, I would expect "/day" to be the command, so we should keep it in typeahead.  But maybe we would have "/theme" be in the top 5 with things like "/me" and "/poll" and "/settings", and you would only see day/dark/light/night if you typed d/d/l/n.</p>

<p>Re <code>/settings</code>, it comes down to levels of nesting? Really <code>/settings theme dark</code> == <code>/theme dark</code> == <code>/dark</code>? Perhaps everything could be in <code>/settings ...</code> in some hypothetical complete slash-command implementation, with the others being default but customizable shortcuts at an organization or user level, allowing freeing up the root namespace for specific needs.</p>

<p>I suppose one tricky thing with a nested command like "theme" is that you'll want to only have one item in the tab complete until somebody types "th" or something.  Although maybe that's unnecessary, as long as "theme" doesn't crowd out me/poll/settings/etc.</p>

<p>Is it reasonable to achieve the first by simply hand-sorting the slash-commands, ie. avoiding the auto-sort we do? A test of that looks to work OK.<br>
Adding theme (or maybe as a different name, based on existing descriptions?) next makes sense, but if leaving at 5, then the remaining typeaheads are all grouped (width, color-modes/themes) so the extra one will be strange.<br>
However, we could add todo to typeaheads and put that in, if it's considered polished enough? tictactoe seems a little broken and toylike, and I'm not sure trivia/zform is there yet either.<br>
Alternatively, we could group the width commands?<br>
It strikes me that we don't have a discovery mechanism for slash commands, but perhaps we could add a tip to them to use <code>/slash</code> or similar, to list them all (in typeaheads, most likely), it not being in typeaheads?</p>

<p>Re naming 'theme', we currently use "color scheme" and day/night/light/dark "mode". Those other options seem to suggest less-concise 2-word solutions, so perhaps we should stick to theme, if we go ahead with this.</p>

<p>I’m still negative on the entire concept of slash commands, for the simple reason that they have no business being messages that you compose in the compose box. It’s illogical from a UI perspective, and it means that the failure mode of typos, or of commands supported in some server versions but not others, is immediate public embarrassment (I expect we’ll learn this the hard way as soon as someone sends “/setings password hunter2” to #general).</p>

<p>I do agree that it is sort of shoe-horning a terminal-like interface into a box to compose messages, and it's not as clean a match as with eg. IRC. There are alternatives I can imagine, like switching the compose box into "command mode" or similar with a more complex command, but... that's ultimately what a leading <code>/</code> does.</p>

<p>But then you can’t send an actual message starting with a slash.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>It’s not though. This all started with <code>/me</code>, but <code>/me</code> is a message formatting directive, not a command. It’s not even a command in IRC.</p>

<p>Re wanting to start regular messages with a slash: this server is only representative of one community, which of course has varied over time, but I'd be interested to see statistics on the number of messages starting with slashes that weren't mistyped slash-commands. I can imagine file paths being an issue - but if typing a message then I'd think it could sit within the message not right at the start and quoting would fix it anyhow. Pasting without quotes is the only issue I can see. Admittedly slash-command conflicts might filter some uses at the UI level, but that's a "don't use slash commands" argument, rather than "check if a slash-command is valid" one.</p>

<p>Just to categorize the syntax we already have, here is the exhaustive list:</p>
<ul>
<li>formatting directives: /me, /poll, /todo</li>
<li>UI shortcuts: /day, /light, /dark, /night, /settings, /fluid-width, /fixed-width, </li>
<li>misc: /ping</li>
</ul>
<p>It's worth noting that we still don't tab-complete either /todo or /ping.  I put <strong>/ping</strong> under miscellaneous, because unlike the UI shortcuts, there is no other current mechanism to ping the server to get the round-trip time.  Whereas all the UI shortcuts are totally achievable by going into the settings menu.  Also, advanced users can get to settings with a couple keystrokes (esc/g/down/enter, roughly).</p>

<p>One of the reasons I've been wishy washy on actually opposing slash commands is that I think the current set of them are actually harmless.  The typo failure mode really only becomes an issue when slash commands become more powerful, as in the example of "/setings password hunter2".  I don't think anybody is gonna be embarrassed now by typing "/dax" or "/nigxt" or "/fluxd-width" by accident.</p>

<p>And even if we were to expand the power of slash commands, the simple remedy would be to warn users if they are sending malformed slash commands.  Basically, if a message starts with "/" in the client, we only send it to the server as message if it starts with /me or /poll or /todo.  (A user who is determined to say "/etc/hosts needs to be updated" could override.)</p>

<li>message formatting: /me, /shrug</li>

<p>I think they pitched something like you could basically do all your SalesForce tasks from Slack.  When your lead got a new comment, the integration would send a message to Slack saying "ticket 99 has a comment: Mary get off the call, they are ready to purchase," and then you would do something slick directly from Slack like "/update-ticket 99 high-priority".</p>

<p>I was skeptical then, and I'm still skeptical now, that this type of automation with third party tools really makes sense.  I think it's almost always more logical to have integrations send a link to the actual third party app, like we do with our GitHub automation.

<p>I would be fine if the particular conversation about slash commands just kinda fizzles out, and then we decide to <strong>do nothing</strong> until we really have a compelling use case that is customer-driven, today, in 2020.</p>
<p>There might be a more interesting broad conversation about how to make certain UI tasks easier to accomplish, but if we have that conversation, I hope we think more broadly about other solutions, such as dedicated command interfaces or better UI organization or a direct hotkey into display settings.</p>

<p>As I hinted last night, I see the (perhaps blurry) distinction between the two types of "commands", but I'm not convinced it's worth making that move unless showing that difference is useful. Conceivably we could toggle into a 'command mode' (for those things not generating messages? in the current narrow?) via eg. <code>ctrl /</code> and not need the leading slashes (and avoid the possibility of posting messages) - but then things like <code>/me</code> will still be used in 'compose mode', which feels odd. Unless that kind of design becomes useful or clearer, I'm also inclined to stick with what we have - and independently of adding more dangerous/embarrassing commands, I think we can improve the interface.</p>

<p>Reviving this discussion, and thinking about next steps...</p>
<p>Here are the slash commands we have (at least as of 2020-09-19):</p>
<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="58">Steve Howell (showell)</span> <a href="#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/slash.20commands/near/1020612">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just to categorize the syntax we already have, here is the exhaustive list:</p>
<ul>
<li>formatting directives: /me, /poll, /todo</li>
<li>UI shortcuts: /day, /light, /dark, /night, /settings, /fluid-width, /fixed-width, </li>
<li>misc: /ping</li>
</ul>
<p>It's worth noting that we still don't tab-complete either /todo or /ping.  I put <strong>/ping</strong> under miscellaneous, because unlike the UI shortcuts, there is no other current mechanism to ping the server to get the round-trip time.  Whereas all the UI shortcuts are totally achievable by going into the settings menu.  Also, advanced users can get to settings with a couple keystrokes (esc/g/down/enter, roughly).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do folks think about simply removing the UI shortcut commands? Does anyone here actually make use of them and would feel sad if they disappeared?</p>
<p>I think it would also be reasonable to implement <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="7">@Tim Abbott</span> 's suggestion (quoted below), but I wonder if we can leave this as a later follow-up, if these commands are hardly being used in the first place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you did some hotkey sequence (alt+/ or something), we could pop up a modal for doing this sort of thing.</p>

<p>I use the <code>/night</code> / <code>/day</code> slash commands often to try to avoid theme-dependant UI bugs in the development environment without going through 5 clicks via settings.  I think that's a problem that could be solved other ways, but I would want to solve it.</p>

<p>I aware that expanding slash commands is a polarizing topic, but I would like to point out that an <code>/away</code> command would be most helpful to 'set yourself as unavailable'. I'm not aware of a string of keyboard commands that can do the same as succinctly as <code>/away</code> could. Is there a better way to do this via [web]?</p>

<p>I don’t think there’s opposition to adding some kind of command UI for power keyboard users—it just shouldn’t be one where the consequence of a typo or a server version mismatch is that you accidentally send a message to whatever stream you happened to be looking at.</p>

<p>Yeah, the fact that I cannot do this via keyboard shortcuts and pressing tab a few times in the web ui is what I was addressing. It's a common slash command to Slack and IRC users. I don't know if that's something that the Zulip community would agree is necessary, but it does point out that there are just some things you can't easily do without a mouse.</p>

<p>I would definitely appreciate more focus on natural keyboard navigation vs. slash commands.  But I also think “/away” is a pretty natural candidate for a slash command, and I don’t have the same level of concern about accidents as Anders has here.</p>
