<p>I was working on this issue <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/20935">#20935</a>  to hide the unread counts and replace them with the three-dot menu on hover. However, the issue was written a year ago, and a lot has changed since then. With the new direct messages section, the proposed issue does not seem to be right with the current UI. I tried to solve the issue, but I think the issue description needs to be changed. I think instead of replacing the location of the three dots with unread counts, maybe the unread counts should be placed in the location of the three dots to maintain consistency.</p>

<p>I think it's possible we should close this issue as wontfix, as current thinking is that we'd use that the the column that currently has the <code>\vdots</code> menu for a <code>pinned</code> icon for pinner streams/topics when not hovered. But I'll leave it as-is for <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="19257">Alya Abbott</span> to review.</p>

<p>Yeah, let's close this out. I think it's been superseded by <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="101" href="/#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/UI.20redesign.3A.20left.20sidebar">#design &gt; UI redesign: left sidebar</a> .</p>
