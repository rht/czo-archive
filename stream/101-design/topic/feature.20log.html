<p>I have wanted to add a feature log for some time; we don't currently have any mechanism other than the changelog and blog posts for advertising new features.</p>

<p>I can't find previous conversations about this, but I do recall discussion along the lines of sending PMs, etc.<br>
Here's how discord does it:<br>

<p>We might want to be more granular for <a href="http://zulipchat.com" title="http://zulipchat.com">zulipchat.com</a>, since they aren't tied to major releases, and we want to keep our paying customers happy.  So I could see having two or three of these per release cycle.</p>

<p>If somebody wants to work on this, I think you can add a lot of value by just reading the commit logs and doing your best job of picking out four or five really cool new things from the last couple months.  And then Tim can always edit them, re-format them, etc., as needed.</p>

<p>Maybe add a setting which lets the admins choose whether to show the updates every time. We can have that disabled for czo.</p>

<p>Since we are aiming for end-users over here, I guess we could add some appealing stuff too. Not just update logs per se, but more like how updates are shown in app stores.</p>

<p>We worked on the valuable feedback by our users and here are the latest updates!</p>

<p>For V1 I think <a href="https://pypi.org/project/towncrier/" title="https://pypi.org/project/towncrier/">https://pypi.org/project/towncrier/</a> might be overkill.  I think the hard part here is generating the marketing copy.  Serving it up in a modal should be easy.  It's worth looking at their page, though, if only for inspiration on some terminology.  I like how they say "news fragments," for example.</p>

<p>Yeah, my worldview as to how this should work is the server diffs the set of announcements with what the user last saw when deciding whether to pop up the notice, and then we mostly just have a changelog-type file that powers it.</p>

<p>So, django's migrations system could be a nice example of how to structure the whole system:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ ls static/updates/*
001-initial.md
002-topic-moving.md
003-markdown-replaced-with-latex.md
</pre></div>


<p>And then a DB field in UserProfile: <code>last_nagged_id</code> as a ShortInt to store which was the last message shown.</p>
<p>We could leverage our markdown rendering extensions for our docs pages here, and that would keep the text readable as well.</p>
<p>Although... we would have to enforce rules like not editing past notices unless its fixing typos etc ourselves.</p>
