<p>facebook groups replaces unread counts above 20 with <code>20+</code>. I think that could be reasonable for us as well; maybe 50 instead of 20, but we've gotten feedback several times that unread counts are more stressful than useful when they get into the 100s. </p>
<p>Thoughts? </p>

<p>Won't it be good if they are replaced with count of distinct users sending those messages?</p>

<p>This sounds like a good idea.</p>

<p>Hmm, maybe I'm weird, but I personally do find it useful to have the count since if I'm catching up on 1000+ messages of history, it's really helpful for e.g. jumping into threads/streams that have a good ratio of my mental model thinking they're likely timely and the total unread count is smaller shorter.  And it also helps with being able to estimate the time required, since you can see if you've done ~half of what you started with today.</p>
<p>As another example of a similar tool, Gmail does the actual count, and I find the details of what that number is useful.</p>

<p>Well, gmail does "number of threads with unread messages" not "number of unread messages". <br>
I think that could also be an option to consider.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think that could be reasonable, though I could also see it having issues.  Worth thinking about.</p>
