<p>From all messages view, When we click on a header like <code>You and someone</code> that narrows to private messages with that person, <em>and opens compose box</em>, but it's not the same for clicking on a topic name from all messages view. Is this intentional for some reason like "people usually narrow to private messages to read?"</p>

<p>Yeah, this is a design choice based on the fact that most messages in a stream/topic are ready many times per message sent, which is a structural fact of large group conversation, while looking at a PMs narrow is very likely to result in wanting to send a message.</p>
