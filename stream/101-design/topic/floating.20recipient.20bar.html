<p>I just narrowed to <a class="stream" data-stream-id="1" href="/#narrow/stream/announce">#announce</a> stream and although the message having my pointer was sent on October 6, the floating recipient bar was showing 5th Oct which was confusing. I think we should update the floating recipient bar info according to the position of the pointer.<br>

<p>(considering that we have an open issue to remove the dates from the separator, I think we could consider this as part of that issue)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-email="harshitbansal2015@gmail.com" data-user-id="907">@Harshit Bansal</span> hmm, interesting feedback.  The current model is that the floating recipient bar shows the date that would appear on the recipient bar of the message it's covering over.</p>

<p>I think that's the right model for what that should show.</p>

<p>However, I think this is a sign that we should improve our date-dividers to work better, since I'd argue the real problem here is that you didn't notice the divider.</p>

<p>Hmm, yeah. One yardstick might be that the dates in the dividers should be no less conspicuous than the ones in the recipient bars. Currently they're rather lighter and I think that makes them easier to miss.</p>
