<p>I think it'd be worth thinking through what the colors should be for our initial streams. Currently it's:<br>

<p>I feel like a project like this is sorely needed. I just wanted to put down some thoughts here on choosing colours and this is going to sound very wishy washy so feel free to ignore this message if you think design is about “making stuff pretty” <span class="emoji emoji-1f642" title="slight smile">:slight_smile:</span></p>
<p>Every colour is associated with certain  emotions. I think our goal while picking colors should take into account what emotion the stream evokes and what colour uniquely identifies that emotion. To give an example the announce stream is usually surrounded by an air of excitement and celebration. We could pick a much more vibrant, exuberant colour for that that is more “striking”.</p>
<p>With this in mind I think we should pick colours on 2 axes -</p>
<p>1) The colour should generally bring about the feeling that stream evokes in a majority of cultures in our demographic<br>
2) How striking/vibrant that colour is should be chosen by taking into account what order it meets the eye in comparison with other colours in the palette. I believe this has to do the with the wavelength of light in the spectrum ( perhaps my physics is off here ) but basically that means red meets the eye first as compared to say blue.</p>

<p>So for streams which we want people to see first we should choose colours higher up in that chart like reds and oranges and pinks and for less urgent or lower priority streams lower down likes blues greens pastels etc</p>

<p>The current colors were chosen in like 2012 and are not associated with stream names at all (it's just a sorted listed).  They were chose with the main goal being colors that are kinda OK on both light and dark backgrounds (i.e. nothing too close to white or black).  I'd love to see a carefully analyzed replacement project (e.g. make a little page showing the current colors on both light and dark backgrounds, with an easy way to show replacements).</p>

<p>one question I don't know the answer to is if we want all the colors to feel sort of uniform sticking-out-ness, or do we want a jumble. The current thing is a jumble, which might actually be good.</p>

<p>A useful definition for a color's 'sticking-out-ness' or what Armaan has described as "striking"-ness from color theory could be 'saturation' from the HSV color model.</p>

<p>I did a bit of searching around and generated a couple of color palettes I think could work using <a href="http://google.github.io/palette.js/" target="_blank" title="http://google.github.io/palette.js/">Google Palette.js</a>. This is a tool which offers a way to preview a lot  well-researched palettes that offer a wide-range of color contrast and work well together.</p>
<p>I generated two possible palettes which I think could possibly work. I created fiddles for them that also intelligently split up the colors so that the colors are furthest apart from each other in groups of 6 ( the way its already setup in <strong>stream_colors.js</strong> ) -</p>
<p>1) <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/armaanahluwalia/7sra3mu2/" target="_blank" title="http://jsfiddle.net/armaanahluwalia/7sra3mu2/">tol-rainbow</a><br>
2) <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/armaanahluwalia/q9o06hdm/1/" target="_blank" title="http://jsfiddle.net/armaanahluwalia/q9o06hdm/1/">HSV rainbow</a></p>
<p>Let me know what you guys think. (If you wanted to fork the fiddle and add your own colors you just have to edit the rawColors array in the code). </p>
<p>I was also restricted by having to select palettes that offer 24 different shades. If we wanted to lower the number of shades on offer, the Google Palette tool has a much wider selection.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how many streams the zulip ships with by default but it may be better to limit the default color palette to 8 or 12 beyond which they selecting a color while subscribing to the stream becomes more important.</p>

<p>I like the custom Zulip palette that Armaan's put together.</p>
<p>I think #ff1654 is a bit too vibrant/saturated, and #f4f1bb and #e6ebe0 are a bit too pale/undersaturated.</p>
<p>I feel like the change in background color from white to semi-saturated dark blue does sort of change the overall visual effect of the palette, but the colors on both backgrounds still look mostly really good, in my opinion.</p>

He feels like the colors are only marginally useful since when subscribed to a large number of streams, they tend to become very similar to each other.</p>
<p>With this in mind I wonder if it would be a useful experiment to allow streams to be associated with <em>both</em> a color and an icon from a predefined set ( or pre-vetted source ) of icons. I'm thinking something akin to how a lot of design systems use a colour and the initials for a unique identification symbol. ( Like the letter MT within a purple circle ). But perhaps we could associate it with an icon and a color which could serve to make them more unique?</p>

<p>I think icons could help convey ideas related to the purposes of streams, but I don't think that Zulip should incentivize associating icons with streams as identifiers that are separate from stream names.</p>

<p>Emoji are part of the Unicode Standard - it's already possible to associate icons with streams by including them in stream names.</p>

<p>I think verbal descriptions are a main characteristic of Zulip's organizational model, and I think colors are a great way to support that.</p>

<p>Using unique icons seems like something much closer to having brand logos for streams, and I don't think individual streams on the same server are different enough in context to merit creating visual identities that are that distinct.</p>

<p>Referencing conversation from the <a href="#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/Unread.20Count.20Styling" title="#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/Unread.20Count.20Styling">unread counts topic</a> -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Right now we reinforce the colors mostly with the recipient bars. I'm not sure how much value adding color to the unread counts would have, since you already have them on the same line as the stream names.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I agree here. It would be more specific, for what it's worth.</p>

<p>I personally feel like having distinct colors is useful.</p>

<p>That being said - using one color or hue for all streams could just be really likable for the aesthetic <span class="emoji emoji-1f642" title="slight smile">:slight_smile:</span>, so I wouldn't be opposed to the idea of some sort of widget or setting that makes it easier to set monochromatic color schemes.</p>
