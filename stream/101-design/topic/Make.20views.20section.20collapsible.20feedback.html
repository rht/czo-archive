<li>Should there be 5 or 6 views in the collapsed state? 6 was feeling too cluttered, so currently I have kept the first 5 views in this PR.<br>
Whether we decide on 5 or 6 views, We currently have 7 views in Zulip in the expanded state(and there will be more in the future), so which 5(or 6) out of these 7 should be kept in the collapsed state? and which 1-2 should not be included (why?).<br>

<ul>
<li>Where to put the remaining view that we chose not to show in a collapsed state? The original Issue <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/25902">#25902</a> states this:<blockquote>
<p>Does it look OK to have 6 icons shown (when the user has scheduled messages)? Or do we need to hide some buttons under a <code>...</code> menu? (We definitely expect to need a <code>...</code> menu once the Inbox view is added.) </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/user_uploads/2/b5/PAe05XPxPAS6iMDszTgpZhyp/image.png">Current combined vdot menu</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/b5/PAe05XPxPAS6iMDszTgpZhyp/image.png" title="Current combined vdot menu"><img src="/user_uploads/2/b5/PAe05XPxPAS6iMDszTgpZhyp/image.png"></a></div><p>But currently, in the PR, the vdot menu already has options combined from all the vdot menus of all views. Which already looks suboptimal as also <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/26035#issuecomment-1728327212">mentioned</a> by Karl:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The vdots menu seems surprising and suboptimal to me. I get that it basically collects all of the different vdots options from the expanded Views area, but having all of those together in a basically decontextualized list is really kind of jarring. Like, it makes me question what it is that I'm looking at with those collapsed icons. This is yet another thing probably worth opening up a discussion about on CZO. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So adding options from different vdots and remaining views in the same vdot menu will make the menu even worse? :(</p>

<p>While we’re thinking about keyboard shortcuts here, a shortcut to access scheduled messages would help make this feature-complete for keyboard users…and just be a nice thing to have for the scheduled-messages feature in its own right.</p>

<p>Hm, for the three-dot menu, it may be better to keep it simple and just show the views there. The other options could just be shown in 3-dot menus for their respective views, with "Mark all messages as read" being attached to the Inbox view.</p>

<p>Yeah it seems fine if you need to either click into a view or expand the section to access those 3dot menus. We might still want a 3dot menu next in the collapsed views line, but that would be for things like a possible future ability to configure custom views or UI for changing the default view without going to settings.</p>

<p>Oh, hm, are you suggesting that we should remove Drafts and Scheduled messages from the left sidebar altogether? Otherwise, we need the three-dot menu to access them.</p>
<p>Removing them might actually be fine, especially if the closed compose box has Drafts button, which I think was the plan? (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="22433">@Vlad Korobov</span> , for some reason I can't find an issue that describes the closed compose box redesign.) I don't know if we'd want to do that right now.</p>

<p>No, I definitely don't want to remove them from the left sidebar -- lots of similar products put drafts there, so it's an intuitive place to look for it, and we used to only have them in the compose area (including the closed compose UI) and lots of people reported "my message disappeared" because they couldn't find it. </p>
<p>But I think it's OK to need to expand the section to access them if we can't fit drafts in to the 5 icons row.</p>

<li>There is no reason to show counters in the folded Views section unless they are unread counters. So no dot should be used for drafts or starred messages.</li>

<p>Folded views is a small convenience for people who really want to have more vertical space. Folded views is not an ultimate replacesr of unfolded views.</p>

<p>So, I feel all the feedback points out to following  Vlad's prototype, so I tried to get the design in the same direction by adding the <code>active view row</code> from the prototype,  just below the collapsed <code>views</code> section. Since this PR is only for functional change and design changes will be another pass once <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="26369">Karl Stolley</span>  cleans up the left sidebar CSS, this design doesn't include all those animations for <code>active view row</code> and also the auto collapsing of <code>views</code> section on scroll and other design changes. But functionally it's mostly the same.<br>

<p>So, adding the <code>active view row</code> below the collapsed <code>views</code> section makes this possible in a nice way, in expanded view, we can access the <code>3-dot</code> menu directly, and in collapsed view, if we are currently in a starred messages, the <code>active view row</code> will be of starred messages and its <code>3-dot menu</code> option can be accessed from <code>active view row</code>.</p>

<p>Did this <span aria-label="thumbs up" class="emoji emoji-1f44d" role="img" title="thumbs up">:thumbs_up:</span>, this also helps remove the transparent unread counter on the starred message which was looking very off, and the drafts view is not shown in the collapsed view so no unread counter for drafts too.</p>

<p>Is the 3dot menu presented for touch screens? That’s the behavior of all the other left sidebar vdots, and I’d think that the collapsed views row should be the same.

<p>As others noted before, the "Drafts" 3-dots menu is a very minor convenience given that we now have a way to delete all drafts from the drafts panel itself. I'm not sure it's an improvement to delete the menu; it's kinda handy and doesn't really cost us anything to have it there. But I think we should definitely not do anything special to try to make it accessible somewhere else as part of this change -- it's just not important.</p>
<p>And scheduled messages doesn't have one, so I think we definitely don't need to spend much attention on the 3-dots menus for those views that cannot be the active view. (And I think one is fairly unlikely to want the other 3-dots menus for these views when not looking at that view). </p>
<p>So I'm on board with the proposal to do nothing at all to make those <code>vdots</code> menus available somewhere else than their existing rows for this transition.</p>

<p>The one exception might be the "mark everything as read" option that we're probably moving to inbox -- so maybe we can put just that in the 3-dots popover for the VIEWS heading row when it's collapsed just so that menu exists matching the design.  (I think that menu will eventually have stuff for configuring custom pinned views, but we're not going to build those sorts of things this year). The one thing I might want to add now is an advertising for changing your default view, as part of advertising that option when we release "Inbox".</p>
<p>I think making these 3-dots menus available in the message feed header area where we do stream descriptions in stream views probably could be an nice little improvement, but that can be a totally independent design idea -- doesn't need to be coupled to this work.</p>

<p>We'll have the three-dot menu regardless for accessing Drafts. I don't think we should duplicate the rarely-used "Mark everything as read" option there.</p>

<p>Yep, definitely not a blocker for left sidebar design changes.</p>
