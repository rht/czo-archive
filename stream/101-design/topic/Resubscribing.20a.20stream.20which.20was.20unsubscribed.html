<p>This is with reference to <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/23943">#23943</a>. The PR allows to choose the default value of <code>push notifications</code> field  on subscribing a stream.</p>
<p>As per current behaviour on resubscribing a stream which was unsubscribed by the user the value of <code>push notifications</code> field will be the value of <code>push notifications</code>at time of unsubscription. So should we keep this behaviour now also or We should just make it equal to the default value of <code>push notifications</code> for the stream irrespective of whether it is first time subscription or resubscription ?</p>

<p>Hey folks, just bumping this question for feedback, since I wasn't sure what's best. To sum up, if a user unsubscribes from a stream and later resubscribes to it, what notification settings should we use?</p>
<ol>
<li>The user's previous notification settings for this stream. [current behavior]</li>
<li>Default notifications settings for this stream.</li>
</ol>
<p>I can see how (1) could be nice, especially if the resubscribe action is due to unintentionally unsubscribing. But (2) seems better if, e.g., a user resubscribes a while later, as their preferences might well have changed.</p>

<p>I agree that (2) seems better. The user's preferences may well have changed; and also using the default settings seems more predictable, in that it isn't governed by state which is hidden or obscure.</p>
<p>(I'm not sure if there is a way in the UI to see your previous notification settings for a previously-subscribed stream. The obvious place it might appear is in the stream settings panel for that stream — but if the notification settings do appear there, they're liable to be highly misleading if they aren't clearly signposted as inactive.)</p>

<p>Yeah, you can see the disabled notification settings for a muted stream (visually marked as disabled) in the Notifications personal settings panel. But unsubscribed streams are not shown there.</p>

<p>Yeah. So if the old settings from when you were previously subscribed aren't even visible in the UI at all, it's confusing to have them reappear and affect the behavior.</p>

<p>Cool, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="24860">@Ujjawal Modi</span> , I think you can update your PR to reset the setting to the stream default when a user re-subscribes.</p>
