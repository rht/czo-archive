<p>I was looking into the CSS and notied that     .app-main  has   max-width: 1400px;       Is there a reason for that? I mean, does it cause issues on some devices  if that is removed?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="8646">@Alex</span> the intent is to prevent the message section from becoming ultra-wide, since that reduces readability.  You can see similar limits on text content width in other websites optimized for reading content, like GitHub and Medium.</p>

<p>It's an interesting decision but also sort of a curious one. Probably the main issue is that on a wide-ish screen, the people icon is removed and the user list is shown by default. If there is an advantage to the narrow chat - and I think that's sort of debatable - it is negated by the list of users on the right. Not really useful to see a list of users unless you are looking for someone.</p>
