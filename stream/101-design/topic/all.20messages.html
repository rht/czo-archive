<p>This was brought up in <a class="stream" data-stream-id="9" href="/#narrow/stream/issues">#issues</a>, but reposting here. <br>
What would folks think of renaming "Home" to "All messages"? That would be less confusing to beginners, and set expectations a bit better. </p>
<p>One downside is that it's not quite all messages, in that it doesn't include muted streams and topics. So we would have to make sure that isn't confusing.</p>

<p>It's not all messages, but "Home" doesn't really encapsulate that it doesn't include muted streams or topics either.</p>

<p>I think "All messages" is better (and probably more accurate than something like "overview").  I don't think the fact that streams/topics that got muted don't show up is likely to be confusing--when you mute a stream or topic you're asking not to see those messages any more and don't really expect to see them in "all the messages you've received" anyway.</p>

<p>There's a search term called <code>is:all</code> that truly brings in "all" messages (which is in quotes because it's only another sort-of-false definition of "all" that doesn't include messages you can't see but that were sent in the realm), but we've already started to deprecate that, I believe, in search suggestions.  So I agree with everybody here.  I agree with Rishi on the basic proposal, I agree with Joshua that "Home" is already an imperfect name, and I agree with James that the likelihood of confusion is small.   I also like "overview" as a possible alternative name, since I think that gets to the heart of why some people like the view.</p>

<p>My one worry with "overview" is that people would expect it to do some sort of summarizing/only showing you the "important stuff" when really it's everything that got sent.  It feels a bit information dense for an "overview" in the usual sense of the word--the thing I like about it/feel is missing from Slack is that it's a "global view" moreso than an "overview"</p>

<p>I call it the "interleaved view."  But I don't propose that as the user-facing name, necessarily.  You're right--it's not an overview.  (We actually could use a nice "overview" type of view that is a little more than the left sidebar provides but not as busy as the home view).   The benefit of the interleaved view, as I perceive it, is that it's totally real time.  You don't have anything happen asynchronously, but it's still somewhat organized.</p>

<p>"All messages" seems worth trying out, I think.</p>

<p>Interesting.  I would prefer "Inbox" to "Home," I think.  For me "All messages" is probably still my favorite suggestion for the web app.</p>

<p>hm, inbox to me suggests something where you can archive/delete (i.e. have a fair amount of control over what's in there)</p>

<p>We don't have an "all unreads" in the webapp, at least, though I could see Inbox making sense there (though I think I'd still prefer "All unreads", at least in the webapp).</p>

<p>Once it is proven in the mobile app, the 'unread' screen can be introduced in the web app tough.</p>

<p>I also  associate email inboxes as being "all the unsorted stuff," i.e. stuff you haven't either manually dealt with or had rules/triggers automatically move to folders. Whereas our interleaved view is mostly sorted.</p>

<p>Another option I was considering is 'Inbox' being the name, but 'Unread/All' be the two view options</p>

<p>I would have a pretty negative reaction when trying out a new app if it presented me with an "inbox". For me an "inbox" means a place where things accumulate that I need to go and take action on -- I don't generally want more of those.</p>
