<p>Just a thought, but have we considered UI alternatives to "reply" for streams/topics? Or maybe also for PMs too?</p>
<p>When considering Zulip "threaded", then some people appear to take "replies" as having some context of the replied-to message (like HN or reddit, or nested email replies by ID?), whereas it is in reality just a reply to the user/group/stream/topic.</p>
<p>The compose area should already make it obvious enough who/where one is "replying to" (there is no other context), but I wondered if a different term  here could make this clearer.</p>
<p>Other systems perhaps avoid this through implicit narrow context, with the compose box always open and only pointing to the that narrow, so where a message goes is "right here" ^</p>

<p>Interesting question.  I do think it's valuable that we support posting to a different place than one's looking at (I use this e.g. to send PMs to the sender of a message on a thread for private feedback on something, as well as various other use cases).  That is of course a rare corner case -- probably 1% of messages are sent that way.</p>

<p>What terminology would you use instead -- just "Compose to stream/topic"?</p>

<p>On originally writing this I was wondering about "respond", but that seems too broad after looking into it.</p>

<p>That was simply to avoid having to have a "... to ..." lengthier form.</p>

<p>I think "reply" would be ok with context, and distinct from "compose" for a new context.</p>

<p>So "Reply to topic" would have less suggestion of a response to a specific message.</p>

<p>It makes it more complex perhaps, but I also enjoy the possibility for different compose contexts. One alternative longer-term solution is multiple active narrows, which has the advantage of seeing previous topic/PM context before replying.</p>
