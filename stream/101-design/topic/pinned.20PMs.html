<p>Hey! A user I was chatting with suggested that it would be useful to pin PMs, and while we have an old issue for this (<a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/10513">#10513</a>), I think it would be worth discussing this a bit in the context of product changes/planned changes since then.</p>
<p>In particular, <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/10513">#10513</a> is currently tagged as a right sidebar issue (and was discussed this way in <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="3" href="/#narrow/stream/3-backend/topic/pinning.20users">#backend &gt; pinning users</a> ), but at least some of the comments on the issue assume that it would be a <em>left</em> sidebar change.</p>
<p>Given that we now have PMs section you can pin open, the left sidebar approach makes more sense to me. I think our plans in <strong>Show stream members in right sidebar</strong> <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/21285">#21285</a> would also make a right sidebar change harder to manage.</p>
<p>What do folks think?</p>

<p>Yes, pinning conversations like streams would be nice... and topics inside Streams too <span aria-label="wink" class="emoji emoji-1f609" role="img" title="wink">:wink:</span></p>

<p>Pinned topics, pinned messages, and pinned PMs all sound useful :)</p>

<p>I think pinned PMs or pinned messages would be most useful to me.</p>

<p>These all sound great, though right now one doesn't visually get the status from users group PMs in the left panel, whereas a 'pinned users' (priority users?) would show that in the right column.</p>

<p>I added clarification that <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/10513">#10513</a> is a right sidebar issue, and filed <strong>Pinned PM conversations</strong> <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/24023">#24023</a>, which should be actionable for a contributor who's excited to pick it up.</p>

<p>I have started the implementation discussion of this feature in <a href="#narrow/stream/49-development-help/topic/Pinned.20PM.20conversations.20.2324023">Thread</a>. It would be greatly appreciated if someone could help with the backend part.</p>

<p>I would recommend asking a specific question (see <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/asking-great-questions.html">https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/asking-great-questions.html</a>) in <a class="stream" data-stream-id="3" href="/#narrow/stream/3-backend">#backend</a> if you are feeling stuck.</p>
