<p>I guess one quirk I want to highlight is the little "Saved as draft" notice that we display when closing the compose box looks a little weird following this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just want to bump this... I think the way the Reply button changes size when a draft is saved doesn't look good, and also (as mentioned previously) the "Saved as draft" notification is really difficult to spot right now. It would be great if we could get this fixed.</p>
<p>Perhaps the notification should be moved out of the bottom row, and should show up right above it instead?</p>

<p>I think that's the simplest plan; I'm not sure what would look visually good here.  The <code>compose_error</code> infrastructure we have is probably not visually appropriate for this.</p>
<p>The other problem with this notice is <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/17396">https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/17396</a> -- basically if you miss the notice, and you're a new user, you potentially panic and think we lost your message.</p>

<p>Drafts at the top-left seems reasonable, putting drafts in the same category as sent messages (which we don't have a link for either, though?).<br>
It will beg the question of whether they can be searched, though, or whether there's a a drafts "narrow", given that's what's up there otherwise. The current drafts popup isn't narrow-like, after all.</p>

<p>i don't think that users care whether something it technically a "narrow" or not, for the most part — i think it would be fine to put drafts there once they're synced to the server, even if we don't have <code>is:draft</code> searches or whatever (mostly just since that adds a lot of complexity, and is not something i think that 99% of users would notice/care about)</p>

<p>Slack also auto-fills the compose box with drafts, which has advantages (you don't need to wonder where a draft is) but also makes it impossible to send a different message to a place where you have a draft (which one does in Zulip pretty often to send a quick reply while composing something longer).</p>

<p>Maybe the actual solution for us is that we should figure out way to advertise any recent drafts that you have in a given narrow while the compose box is open, e.g. a banner "You have 2 drafts from the last day for this view"? </p>
<p>Not something we can do quickly, though, because it'll likely require a lot of iteration around filtering tiny drafts (which I at least leak a few a day of).</p>

<p>i think it's possible to support both usecases, by detecting if the user deletes the draft immediately, and keeping it around as a draft if so, but it's definitely complicated, and would be a bit more annoying for the usecase of trying to keep around a draft</p>

<p>hmm, another bug is that <code>j</code> and <code>k</code> don't work in the drafts screen, which i think contributes to me using the workflow you're describing less (usually, i'll just copy/paste whatever is in the composebox instead of getting it out of drafts, because i thought i couldn't access drafts from my keyboard)</p>

<p>I think not showing anything (and having folks figure out that drafts exist by finding the "Drafts" button) is better than the weird animation we have right now. That might be OK for the release, though it would be great to see a prototype of an animation above the compose area that we could consider.</p>

<p>Sigh, I've reproduced a bug with the tooltip iteration, where the "Saved as draft" notice appears at the left end of the compose box after closing an empty compose box (where no draft is saved).  Probably this is a preexisting bug with when we call the "Render animation" function, that just was previously not visible.  Looking.</p>

<p>I think so instead of showing <code>You have 3 drafts related to this thread.</code>, we can show something like <code>Your last draft for this topic was saved at 15 minutes ago.</code> above the compose box (opened state). And when the user clicks on it, it will open the drafts modal with that draft focused.</p>
<p>I also agree that it will be annoying to show this every time, so we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the tutorial timer for this for about 1 month, where we will show this <code>tip</code> for 1 month to the new user.  Admins can change this duration though. And normal user can turn it off manually in the settings. Or we can lead the normal user to the settings when we are showing this <code>tip</code>.</li>
<li>We can add the <code>is_shown_on_tip</code> attribute to the draft message, so we don't show the <code>tip</code> for the same draft more than one time.</li>
</ul>

<p>I realized that we need to decide the following: should drafts be restored when there is no valid addressee? (e.g. only stream specified, only topic specified, or nothing specified for a stream message or PM)</p>
<p>Proposal:<br>
a. If the addressee is not blank, restore draft only if it exactly matches. E.g. a compose box with stream=<code>general</code> and no specified topic matches drafts with stream=<code>genera</code>l and no specified topic, but does not match drafts with stream=<code>general</code>/topic=<code>Zulip 4.0</code>.<br>
b. Do not restore drafts when the addressee is blank.</p>
<p>What do folks think?</p>

<p>I think "stream set, topic blank" should not auto-restore draft content.  It'll be obvious if we prototype that, but effectively doing so will mean that clicking "new topic" auto-restores whatever last draft you'd have with no topic specified, which seems unlikely to be what you want.</p>

<p>Yes, i agree to this. But we many a times have a draft that we have prepared or writing from long time and we don't want that to send right now.<br>

<p>I just had another UX question on this topic come to mind... What exactly should happen when you have a partially composed message, and you change the stream or topic, or the set of PM recipients? There are multiple things that could be happening:</p>
<ol>
<li>Part way through writing the message, you realized you wanted to send it somewher else. In that case, you want to keep working on the current message, not see old drafts. Perhaps this is the most likely?</li>
<li>You haven't started composing or editing an old draft yet and are in the process of setting the destination for you message; you want to see the draft you have saved for the final context you specify.</li>
<li>Maybe you did start writing a few words before setting the topic/stream or addressees, but the saved draft you have in that context is actually a more written out version of what you were about to say?</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyhow, I wonder if we should be explicitly asking whether or not to open the old draft you have when the addressee is changed? If not, what's the right behavior for what situation?</p>

<p>I think the most likely is you want to send your current message to that new place, and we should move the draft.  If you instead want to keep your draft and send a new message to that new place, you should close compose (saving the draft) and start composing a new message.</p>

<p>Maybe that's right... Though when you start composing a new message, by default it'll restore the draft you just saved, so you'll need to explicitly go look for your old draft.</p>

<p>The actual job of the <code>Saved as draft</code> tooltip is to inform the user that the message is successfully saved as a draft (and the message is not lost).</p>

<p>Playing with the PR... I think in the special case when the compose box is empty, and you change the addressee, it <em>should</em> restore the draft you have for that addressee. (It currently does not.) Do folks agree?</p>

<p>Currently, I have implemented to check if the draft can be restored as value changes. <br>
But it creates an issue when some topic has a similar name (for eg: <code>topic</code>, <code>topic 2</code>).  <br>
As I hit the spacebar after <code>topic</code> it changes the focus to textarea.<br>

<p>Mmm, yeah, I think from a user experience perspective, the above looks right -- restore drafts unless the user has just saved the draft ... I'll leave it to other folks to comment on the implementation details. :)</p>

<p>My theory was that we only want to restore the latest draft when opening the compose box afresh to a recipient; if the user had an empty compose box and then edits the topic field, that shouldn't do anything with drafts since the intent appears to be sending something new.</p>

<p>I'm not sure about that... For example, for starting a new topic, my workflow is usually to click on the stream, open the compose box, and change the topic name to the new one. If I already started a draft for that new topic, I would want to get it restored.</p>

<p>We have one more condition in the new delete draft behavior to discuss,<br>
"What should we do if the length of the text is <code>&gt;0</code> and <code>&lt;= 2</code> ?"</p>
<p>Currently, we don't save the message/update the draft if the length of the text is <code>&lt;=2</code>. </p>
<p>We can do the following things,</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete the draft if the length of the text is <code>&lt;=2</code>(instead of  <code>0</code> ).</li>
<li>Save the message/Update the draft if the length of the text is <code>&gt;0</code>(instead of <code>&lt;=2</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>I think so we should go with the first option as it seems natural.</p>

<p>I think that makes sense... The one use case I can think of that it wouldn't work for is if you use drafts as a to-do list ("messages I have to respond to"), and are trying to do so by just typing 1-2 characters. But if we haven't heard complaints more generally about drafts &lt;=2 characters not being saved, I think it should be the same here.</p>

<p>Hello - I'd like to look into this and see if it's possible that we can get something working and maybe even shippable!</p>

</ul>
<p>Already open PRs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/18613">#18613</a>: compose: Restore the last draft when compose box is opened. <ul>
<li>I checked this out locally and got it rebased and working for what was implemented so far.</li>
<li>The clear draft button has not been implemented yet, so it would need to be added to the PR (possibly along with extra logic to get the most recent draft).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/18718">#18718</a>: compose box: Rotate drafts in compose box.  (experimental, separate from the current proposal)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Changes that need to be made:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a user has an open compose box with at least one draft for the current addressee (either stream/topic or PM), the most recently edited draft for that addressee is auto-restored in the compose box. <em>Status: done</em></li>
<li>Deleting the text in the compose box deletes the draft instead of keeping it saved. <em>Status: done</em></li>
<li>Start a new message when there's an existing draft by clicking a new "Save and clear" button that saves a draft and clears the box. <em>Status: not started.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Further thoughts on starting a new message when there’s an existing draft (both mine and others' from above)</p>
<ul>
<li>We can do something very simple and implement something like Slack where we allow only one draft per topic, and let users turn off the "restore drafts" feature if they don’t like this regression. We can also do this first and let there be more than one draft per topic in the future. I’m not sure how many users would be okay with this tradeoff, but I'd be interested to find out.</li>
<li>The existing proposal is to add a new "save and clear" button that saves a draft and clears the box. I think if we do this we should make it really clear that this doesn't close the compose box. Most of the time I want to save a draft is when I'm leaving the compose box and want to make sure it was saved. With the existing proposal, if I click the button then the box will clear and stay open. Writing a second draft might happen infrequently enough that it's strange to make a button just for that.</li>
<li>More complicated proposal (which might confuse user): Save if the user explicitly saved the draft with the button (store in the database). Only open the last draft if it was auto-saved and not explicitly saved with the button, because this is more likely to have been an accidental click away.</li>
</ul>
<p>Possible other features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Auto-loading a draft when the user types the relevant topic into an empty compose box (including starting with empty topic field).</li>
<li>If there are saved drafts for that specific topic/message view that aren’t currently in the compose box, show a banner communicating that this is the case. The user can click on this banner to open a dialog with only the relevant drafts.</li>
<li>Give user an option to turn this feature off.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think so this will make UX very confusing. What we can do instead IMO is enable <code>auto-save</code> by default and add an option to switch to "Save only when <code>Save</code> button is clicked". The same goes for auto-loading the draft, the default behavior will auto-loading while the user will have the option to switch it off. <br>

<p>Essentially, if we only allow one draft at a time (not for the whole app, but per conversation thread) then we don't need to design a way to start a new draft when there's already an existing one. This is how Slack and Discord currently work. Zulip has the nice feature of being able to create as many drafts as you want per conversation, though this also adds extra design questions for this feature. Does that make sense? Happy to explain further.</p>
<p>This is mostly Wesley's idea:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is to unblock us loading drafts into the composebox by default, right? If so, I'm not totally convinced by this approach — it's a lot of screen real estate for what I'd imagine is a pretty uncommon action, and one that users probably have more intuitive ways to deal with (copy draft, paste into text editor/doc/etc, write quick reply, copy draft back over). Or even write short response above the draft, cut the draft, send the short response, and paste the draft back into the composebox so it's re-saved.</p>
<p>This seems like a very niche feature, which is unlikely to be very generally useful or understandable, and my preference would be to just have it so that one can only have one draft per topic (or, if we think that will seriously annoy power users, add an option to disable auto-loading drafts, which we will possibly want to do anyways).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If there are saved drafts for that specific topic/message view that aren’t currently in the compose box, show a banner communicating that this is the case. The user can click on this banner to open a dialog with only the relevant drafts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To clarify this a bit -- if users can create multiple drafts per conversation, it might be difficult for them to find those drafts. They could do the rotation thing you put up in that PR, and I was suggesting another way for them to discover a collection of drafts -- if they can open a popup, then they can see the full text for all the current drafts for that conversation, and pick the one they want (and also delete ones they don't want).</p>

<p>Auto-loading a draft when the user types the relevant topic into an empty compose box (including starting with empty topic field).</p>

<p>I think I was imagining this as part of the implementation.</p>

<p>This is now feature complete at <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/22104">#22104</a>! The button is a bit ugly because I wasn't sure what the best thing to do with it was, given we haven't made the send dropdown yet (I can make it now if we want?)</p>
<p>I'd love to hear folks' thoughts on it if you have time to try it out :)</p>

<p>Nice! After playing around with this, I'm thinking we should actually have a dropdown attached to <strong>Drafts</strong>, rather than the <strong>Send</strong> button.</p>
<p>It would have the following options:</p>
<h2>View N more drafts for this conversation [only shown if N &gt; 0]</h2>
<ul>
<li>This would link to Drafts, which would have the new "Drafts from this conversation" section at the top.</li>
<li>It would probably obviate the need for other ways to view/scroll through drafts, at least for the initial version.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Save to drafts and start new message</h2>
<ul>
<li>This would replace the "Compose new message" button</li>
<li>We can play with the wording, but the advantage is that we don't have to be as succinct since it's a menu option, rather than an always-visible piece of UI.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>That seems like a reasonable place to put it! Would there still be an option to click to see all drafts? And would the drop-down only be there if a draft is auto restored (as I currently have it)?</p>

<p>I think there should still be in all drafts option. Maybe it could be the main part of the button, and there would be the drop-down part on the right?</p>

<p>And I'm pretty sure that only showing this when I draft is auto restored is what makes most sense, but down hear other thoughts on it</p>

<p>I would leave Save To drafts under Send button drop down.<br>
For the Drafts if we have saved drafts in this conversation I would show a counter. Something like:<br>
<strong>Drafts</strong>  <code>2</code></p>

<p>To sum up the call, our current plan is to move the button to the Drafts popover for now. It's a power user feature that requires quite a few words to explain, and we'd like to get it out of the way for most users. We also discussed potentially adding it to a <strong>Send</strong> button menu once we need that menu for the "Send later" feature.</p>

<p><em>(I haven't read most of this topic yet; in case there's relevant context above. Although I searched for "night", "dark", and "theme" here and didn't see anything.)</em></p>
<p>I'm thinking that the "Saved as draft" tooltip might be too easy to miss on the dark theme, although maybe on the light theme as well. This was tangentially prompted by <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="101" href="/#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/Closing.20compose.20box">#design &gt; Closing compose box</a>, although it's not really related to the issue there.</p>
<p>I know a lot of users have had confusion in the past where they thought a message they were writing was lost, when it was actually saved in a draft, and that that was part of the reason for adding a notification in the first place. Then it became a tooltip, but it was still down by the compose bar, so any color contrast issues were lessened because a user's eyes would immediately go down there if the compose box closed unexpectedly, and they'd see the notification. But at the new location in the top left, this works against the user now; their eyes are going to move down toward the compose box, away from the tooltip at the top left.</p>
<p>Maybe there could be a notification banner above the compose box, in addition to or replacing the existing tooltip? I see that there was <a href="#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/saved.20as.20draft/search/banner">some discussion of banners previously</a>, including showing a banner about existing drafts when the compose box is open, so that's another way to solve this. Having the notification banner – or a persistent banner as also mentioned previously, or anything similar – catches the user sooner though, before they get up in frustration and fume for a while, only to come back ready to start writing the message again and see that it was there the whole time. <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span></p>
