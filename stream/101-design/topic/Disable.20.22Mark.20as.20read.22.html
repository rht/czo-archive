<p>Can we make these buttons not look so disabled in light mode?  (Even when the buttons are disabled, they are super faded until you hover over them.)  If we're not going to hide buttons that don't apply, we need to make it clear which buttons are active.  I personally support just hiding them, but my main point here is to point out the status quo is broken.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what icon would be better. We need to avoid confusing this with the "resolve topic" checkmarks, which a green tick would be more similar to than the current icon. And we already have a visual representation of the number of unreads in the topic, which if absent indicates no unreads, so it seems like it'd be redundant information.</p>

<p>From a design coherence perspective, if we were to have an icon to say "fully read", I'd probably want to put that where we show the unread count, but I think it's visually easier to scan with that as a blank space, as we do in the left sidebar.</p>

<p>I think the faint styling we have for these icons is meant to match that of the "muted" icon we have in the message recipient bars in message feeds; those two components share CSS. So one option would be to just leave these icons as-is for now and adjust them as we're adjusting that part of the recipient bar in redesign work.</p>

<p>I'd like to have a bit of a focused discussion about the change to using the unread counter as a "mark as read" button. I think the two main concerns I've heard flagged are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Discoverability</strong>. </li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>. In particular, other unread counters don't mark messages as read at the moment.</li>

<p>(2) seems like a bigger problem.</p>
<p>How would we feel about unread counters marking messages as read in the left and right sidebars? It seems easier for that to happen accidentally due to a misclick, so I feel like we'd want to add a confirmation if we go that route.</p>

<p>On the advantages of this approach side, I think we can just remove the "mute topic" button from the Recent topics UI, in which case we wouldn't have any dedicated action buttons between the topic and participants, which will be cleaner.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="19257">@Alya Abbott</span> we could leave in place such flow: counter itself isn't a button, but when hover/click the counter there is a tooltip menu (like when clicking on more button) with a single item inside it "Mark all messages as read" so when you click that menu item you make things as read without going inside.</p>

I think these are the remaining TODOs for this recent topics detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're using the down arrow in the unread column for topics, it moves to the topic name column whenever you cross over a topic with nonzero unreads. I'm not sure what would be best here -- one option would be to have the cursor underline the blank space where the unread count would normally be, and have hitting <code>Enter</code> in that context mark the topic as unread (i.e. have it serve as a toggle). I think that would essentially mean reverting much of <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/45743ea195c36520d5554170d573a90fe2f981de">45743ea195c36520d5554170d573a90fe2f981de</a>, but that's OK.</li>
<li>If you hit <code>Enter</code> while your cursor is over the unread count / mark as unread icon to mark a topic as read while filtering to only see unread topics, your cursor disappears (because the row you were on disappeared), whereas I'd expect it to move to the next row (if any). <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="14842">@shlok (madrix01)</span> can you debug this and submit a follow-up PR?</li>
<li>As noted in the original issue, we need documentation updates for <a href="https://zulip.com/help/recent-topics">https://zulip.com/help/recent-topics</a> and <a href="https://zulip.com/help/marking-messages-as-read">https://zulip.com/help/marking-messages-as-read</a>.</li>
</ul>
