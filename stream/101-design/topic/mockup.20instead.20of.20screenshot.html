<p>How about we put a working mockup in home page rather than keeping a screenshot? Users can play with Zulip in <a href="http://zulipchat.com" target="_blank" title="http://zulipchat.com">zulipchat.com</a> home page and get a feel of Zulip. <br>
We don't have to keep the entire UI(probably just the stream sidebar and message viewport. )</p>

<p>Kind of like <a href="https://quilljs.com" target="_blank" title="https://quilljs.com">https://quilljs.com</a>.</p>

<p>Also we can make use of the hotspots to explain what exactly the UI is.</p>

<p>Oh interesting, you mean this, but just have the stream and topic links in the left sidebar work?</p>

<p>Yup. A mockup the same as the screenshot you created but users should be able to interact with it.</p>

<p>cool, that's a great idea. Will work on a draft of it.</p>

<p>I really like that idea. Having said that I do feel that <em>requiring</em> interaction may be more than what is necessary for a user to get the relevant information out of it. I would more favor a 3 - 5 second animated loop showcasing the benefits of the threading model and in the process also showcasing the UI.  In general, from a non-demo page, we should aim to minimize the effort it requires for a user to capture the maximum possible information.</p>
<p>On a related note -- I really think there should be a link on the top nav that says <em>Demo</em>. Thats almost immediately the first link I look for when going to a product website and when I don't find one it almost always means I mark that as a negative in my head.</p>

<p>I guess to be more clear the main problem is I have no idea how to demo the product. On slack it clearly guides you to "Create a workspace" or "Find workspaces you can join" .... on <a href="http://zulipchat.com" target="_blank" title="http://zulipchat.com">zulipchat.com</a> it says "Find Accounts" which on entering the site for the first time makes no sense to me instead of something like a Try ZulipChat link to <a href="http://chat.zulip.org" target="_blank" title="http://chat.zulip.org">chat.zulip.org</a> or another realm that serves Demoing customers.</p>

<p>That's true; our CTA is see plans and pricing, which we should reconsider.</p>

<p>and yeah, I think starting with a gif loop makes sense, since that's a pre-req for the interaction in any case :).</p>
