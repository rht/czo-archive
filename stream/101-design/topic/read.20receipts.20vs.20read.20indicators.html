<p>What are everyone's thoughts on read-receipts feature naming? I have been mostly using <code>read_indicators</code> in the code but <code>read_receipts</code> is what's used everywhere else and probably makes more sense?<br>

<p>I feel like "read receipts" is how I've usually this class of feature mentioned in documentation for other tools.</p>

<p>Yes, that sounds more natural. I was inclined to use indicators having worked on typing indicators. I guess it doesn't make much sense in read receipts context.</p>

<p>I think there is a difference:</p>
<ul>
<li>“read indicator”: I’ve read this message.</li>
<li>“read receipt”: I know that <em>you’ve</em> read this message.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hmm, thanks for making the difference clear, <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="699">Anders Kaseorg</span>! So, we'd use the term (read) indicator when we have code marking as or sending read data? (to be clear, we don't have to do any mark as read operations here, asking just to make sure what I understood is right :)</p>
<p>Yeah, read receipts seems to make more sense. Will change to read_receipts in the [PR.] (<a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/18935">https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/18935</a>)</p>

<p>We already have unread “markers” and we don’t need to rename them—I’m just saying “indicators” is close enough to be interpreted as a synonym of that.</p>
