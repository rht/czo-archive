<p>Curious if folks have thoughts on this idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The interleaved message view is very confusing for new users. As a fix for this, we added Recent Topics, but this only prevents the top-level of interleaved messages — when a user clicks on a stream in the left sidebar, they're dropped into a interleaved view again.</p>
<p>Instead, we should allow Recent Topics to filter by stream, and then add a mode (and eventually enable it by default, if all goes well) where Recent Topics is the default view from clicking a stream on the left sidebar, or clicking a <code>#**stream**</code> link.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This also has the advantage that you aren't forced to sacrifice an unread message to expand a stream.</p>

<p>We have definitely though about doing this. There are different UX that different people like. We need to make this a setting probably that clicking on a stream in left sidebar filters by stream in recent topics instead of narrowing to the stream.</p>

<p>I assume this would be filtered by stream, so doesn't this end up effectively being the equivalent of the "expand all topics" but with a little more info as per recent topics (eg. users contributing)?</p>

<p>Indeed.  And it's possible that we'll want to change the behavior of the "more topics" link when we have the new RT view.</p>

<p>I certainly support not marking as read as often, and I expect that recent topics could be expanded further to handle different filters like this. However, it feels like slowly developing a different (potentially complex) UI based on recent topics, which co-exists with the current UI; that feels like a messy approach to present to users, unless I'm missing something.</p>

<p>Yeah, the left sidebar doesn't have enough horizontal space to make something like "Recent topics" work there...  You really need to have both stream and topic in the same line in order to sort by recency, because otherwise you have a million copies of the same stream heading.</p>

<p>I think this depends on how opinionated the project is supposed to be.</p>
<p>Small steps like this feels like a safe way to transition to something better, which might be fitting for a less opinionated project:</p>
<ol>
<li>If this starts out as an opt-in setting, new users are not affected, and those who want to try it out can do so.</li>
<li>If everyone agrees that the new way is better for most users, it can be made default.</li>
<li>Then if it's decided that the interleaved interface is not worth maintaining, it can be removed entirely.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's more complexity, yes, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be more complexity forever. And I think it's valuable to try improving Zulip in these types of ways. I don't know how this project is being run, but I imagine it could be hard to convince many people to make a huge change of removing the interleaved view and also make an improved recent topics view its replacement at the same time for the sake of keeping complexity down.</p>

<p>I'm currently working on this issue. As discussed above, we can start by adding a setting of default view. <br>
For URL :</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/#narrow/stream/101-design/recent_topics</code> opens recent topics view for streams, this may require work for adding logic for operators and operands.</li>
<li><code>/#narrow/stream/101-design</code> opens interleaved interface.</li>

<p>Step 1 for this is to add stream filter to recent topics regardless of anything else.

<p>Adding a stream filter is more complicated on the UI side than the filtering side for this project, so I don't see it as a blocker to this.</p>

<p>My understanding of the main blocker for this is how we load data for Recent topics. In particular, we load a fixed number of topics and <em>then</em> filter it, and there's no way to load more topics. So if you have a bunch of recent traffic in other streams, we can end up putting the user in an awkward situation where we show a small number of messages with no way to get more history.</p>

<p>After playing with the PR (thanks <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="21453">Evy</span> for rebasing!) and chatting with <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="7">Tim Abbott</span> , here's a proposed plan for next steps on moving this forward:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add a way to load more conversations to the bottom of the Recent conversations view. Chatting with <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="7">Tim Abbott</span> , a relatively straightforward way to do this from a technical perspective would be a notice that says: "You're viewing conversations with messages sent since [date]. <a href="http://">Load older conversations</a>" (exact wording TBD).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the same notice to the stream-based view. This is where it's pretty critical, because there may well be very few conversations to show once we filter by stream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rather than opening the recent topics-style view from the left sidebar, have it open via clicking the name of a stream in Recent conversations. (This currently goes to the topic rather than the stream, which is a bit odd, but we had wanted to avoid taking users to an interleaved view.) This is a low-visibility access point, but would allow us to integrate all the technical changes without having to nail UX questions at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test on CZO opening this view from clicking a stream name in the left side bar (as in the current PR). I'm not sure if we need to add an interleaved stream view button, similar to the one we have for DMs, or if we can test it without. Regardless, we'll likely want that button for the actual feature.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>How does that sound?</p>
