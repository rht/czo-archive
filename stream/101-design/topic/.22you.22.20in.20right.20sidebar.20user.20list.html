<p>In preparation for adding controls for your own active/inactive status, we've stopped excluding the current user from the right sidebar user list.  Here's one version of what that might look like (currently in master); I'm about to deploy here with a different version for comparison.<br>

<p>I'd love feedback on how folks feel about this.  There's two variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>How we implement and style the "(you)" part.  We need some special styling to distinguish from that being part of the name.</li>
<li>Whether we sort your to the top, or at your normal alphabetical place.</li>
</ul>

<p>“You” feels more awkward than “Me” as we want the user to feel ownership over the page. That’s why traditionally things are named “My Account” instead of “Your Account”.</p>
<p>In this case I feel like a combination of being sorted to the top and having “(me)” in a bold font with that faded gray colour would work fine.</p>

<p>I would prefer my own name to be at the top of the list.  I think having your name always be at the top makes it easier to tune it out (in a good way) over the long haul, while still making it convenient if you want to do  something like send a message to yourself.  I also think it would also serve as kind of a visual reference point.</p>

<p>That's basically why we've never shown it up until now--most of us do indeed know our own name, and we know implicitly that we're present.  I've just found over the years I'd rather have it explicit that I'm online.  And the menu items attached to the buddy list make sense for me as well others--for example, I may wish to send a message to myself, and it's convenient.  Or check my profile.  And there's also the small-org case where only you are online, and we don't want a totally empty buddy list.</p>
