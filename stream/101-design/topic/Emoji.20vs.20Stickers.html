<p>I think it is a good idea to think of emojis as purely 'text size' and 'standard set'. And stickers as anything that is custom and can be displayed larger. For non-professional chat apps, this is a huge feature. For Slack not so much.</p>

<p>Agreed that's the distinction between these; I'm curious why you're thinking about this?</p>

<p>Mostly to keep in mind the difference... for example, not sure what was the talk about 'custom emojis' that I read somewhere. But if it is something that has no alternative in the default emoji-set to not add them. I know that 'stickers' are simple problem from technical standpoint, and not so simple from the 'someone has to create these stickers' standpoint ;)</p>

<p>It might be interesting to have some sort of lightweight, non-professional chat app that is part of the Zulip ecosystem, and it would just use the backend for transport.</p>

<p>A lot of people are still unfamiliar with the concept of "office chat."  Most of those people aren't really our target customers, of course.</p>

<p>Also, maybe 'office chat' is not a strict definition. I imagine if BuzzFeed use Zulip internally, half of their communications to be a stickers :)</p>

<p>Yeah, I'd like a good way to describe Zulip in 5 words or less that doesn't involve either the words "office" or "chat," since I don't think either really capture what it does.  I mean, yeah, it's chat, but it's not your typical chat.  And, like many people, I don't actually use it in an office.</p>
