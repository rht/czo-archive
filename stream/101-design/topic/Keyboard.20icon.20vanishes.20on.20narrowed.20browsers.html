<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="58">@Steve Howell</span>  Just checked while considering poll notification icons that the keyboard vanishes when the screen is narrowed. Is this a bug? It should be there or went under settings or so. Please let me know if an issue needs to be opened as it can be resolved along with the poll notifications.</p>

<p>I don't think it's a bug; it's disappearing at the same time the user list moves to the left side. Just a different layout. It's always available in the menu.</p>

<p>That was changed intentionally. Here’s the issue related to it that was closed recently <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/13122" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/13122">https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/13122</a></p>
