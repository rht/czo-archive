<p>IMO the "Quote and reply or forward" phrasing in the triple dot menu on messages is confusing and overly verbose, especially since there's no way to "forward" a message as a PM (yet).</p>
<p>How would we feel about changing it to "Quote and reply", "Quote message", or just "Quote"?</p>

<p>(IIRC the NYT/wirecutter people were confused about this, and thought that was the only way to reply to a message, so I think removing "Reply" from that option would be good, and changing the icon)</p>

<p>Any of those shorter versions definitely sounds like an improvement.</p>
<p>FWIW GitHub calls their corresponding option "Quote reply".</p>

<p>"Quote reply" is concise but possibly confusing/ambiguous until you're used to it - not a "reply" action but a "quote reply" action? Am I quoting another reply?<br>
The only text ZT has is a fairly long help text of <code>Reply quoting the current message text</code>; we could certainly do another iteration on that there, but a shortened form of that such as <code>Reply quoting this message</code> seems good.<br>
For context, the web app appears to have <code>Quote and reply to message</code> in the help text, so it seems good to synchronize those to some extent in any case.</p>

<p>The  "forward" text was added to it since users were finding it difficult to know how to forward messages. Since <code>Quote</code> is a good way to forward messages too, this solves the issue. We haven't heard any complaints from users since then about this afaik.</p>

<p>The non-intuitive way to copy and forward messages is to view the message source and then copy the message. This is not known to many users and trying to copy just text using cursor drag doesn't preserve formatting.</p>

<p>Hmmm, interesting. Is that a common thing that people want to do? I'd be curious to see where we got the feedback that that was too difficult.</p>
<p>This thread is a result of hearing some folks at a company that uses Zulip being confused about what "forward" meant in this context on a social call. They thought it meant that it would let you PM someone the message, which isn't even really true, since we don't let you switch from a topic composebox to a PM composebox with the same message content.</p>
<p>My guess is that this is people that are used to WhatsApp? Are there other messaging apps that have "forward" as a common thing?</p>

<p>It's good to have the symbol reachable on the keyboard, though. I have a habit of copying parts of messages and pre-pending them with the &gt; symbol to reference and then answer a particular point in a message.

<p>As an aside, being able to properly quote part of a message (by referencing the original author) would be nice, though I can't think of a way to do this. You'd want to highlight some text and them reach for a quote and reply function that targets just the highlighted text. Mostly, I always want to avoid recursive quoting which I find confusing and unsightly.</p>

<p>I agree this would be a handy feature for our "quote" option to have.</p>
<p>GitHub's "Quote reply" option does exactly that: if you've selected part of the message first, it'll only quote that part, instead of the whole thing. I use that feature regularly.</p>

<p>You can do this today somewhat awkwardly by quoting the message and then deleting parts of what the other person sent to just the parts you want to reply to.</p>

<p>The "Forward" use case is a thing I use on a regular basis and is not discoverable enough -- it's basically do "quote-and-reply" and then change the recipient.  I think ultimately we want some better mechanism for teaching this idea than this.  We had "Quote and reply" as the name before last summer.  </p>
<p>It's also worth mentioning that we will probably add some sort of "Quote and reply to new topic" more first-class feature that might do backlinks for you, and probably that would end up removing the "or forward" from the name.</p>

<p>I worry that just "Quote" is unclear about what that's going to do to someone who's never used it before (I could imagine someone thinking it copied the message or something).  As a sidenote, this is also the one of the only two strings we have that include the word "reply" in the message UI (the other being "Reply mentioning user" in the avatar menu.</p>
<p>So that was my motivation for preferring "Quote and reply".</p>

<p>Yeah, I can see either way. My preference for "Quote" is both since it's shorter (which I think makes the three-dot menu easier to skim), and because I think "and reply" caused <a href="https://twitter.com/zulip/status/1372265978470440962">this sort of confusion</a>.</p>

<p>I think that confusion was caused by something else, which is that they were specifically trying to check if Zulip had copied Slack's threading feature, and this was the closest thing to Slack-style threads that they could find in 5 minutes (you can grab an old copy of the article from <a href="http://archive.org">archive.org</a> to check if my memory is correct).</p>

<p>My preference is still for "Quote", since it's shorter/easier to skim and I don't think it's something where someone who's looking for it wouldn't find it without the "and reply", but perhaps it's not as confusing as I'd thought.</p>

<p>When <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="22433">Vlad Korobov</span>  and I chatted the other day, he proposed splitting the "Quote and reply or forward" message menu option into two separate options:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Quote and reply", which would have the same functionality as the current option.</li>
<li>"Forward", which would put the same content into the compose box, but change the recipient to be "DM", and (I think) put the cursor into the addressee field.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thoughts? I haven't re-read this thread carefully, but I certainly agree with the <a href="#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/.22Quote.20and.20reply.20or.20forward.20.28.3E.29.22/near/1201423">initial feedback</a> that the current option is not easy to parse/understand.</p>

<p>I agree with the idea.  When I first encountered the new menu style, the first line felt kind of overwhelming.  I also expected "edit message" to be the first line, but that was just a lot of muscle memory, and I don't necessarily think the change there is bad--I am just giving context.</p>

<p>The reason we went with "Quote and reply or forward" was that the menu is already really tall with a bunch of options, and long menus tend to create a feeling of it being overwhelming and hard to find things.</p>

<p>We've already made the menu taller by splitting "move message" and "edit message", and I think once you get up to ~10 items in menu, the menus become really hard to visually skim.</p>

<p>As a quick aside, it appears that I can react to my own message with the hotkey and the interactive menu, but Zulip doesn't hover the emoji icon.  It's a little strange to react to your own message, but YouTube lets you like your own video, and I think there are sort of funny times in Zulip where you would react to your own messages.  Also practical times, just for learning the app.</p>

<p>Yup, basically the current behavior seems to be that you get pencil for your messages, smiley for their messages, but not smiley for your messages.  The current behavior doesn't seem to be driven by any screen real estate concerns.</p>

<p>There is obviously a certain amount of logic that says that you would never react to your own messages, but if you accept that premise, it should be applied consistently.  I personally think you should be able to self-react despite the weirdness of it during most circumstances.</p>

<p>We technically could remove "Edit message" from that menu for messages you sent, and remove "add emoji reaction" for messages someone else sent if we are displaying those icons outside the menu, but doing so has significant downsides; I think "Edit message" in particular would be annoying to not display in the same area as "Move message" and "Delete message".</p>

<p>Just in terms of removing design constraints and thinking out of the box, remember that there is no law that every popup menu has to be a single column of options.  It's certainly more conventional to have menus be single-column, but if there are enough options in a menu to warrant multiple columns, then building a multi-column menu should at least get some consideration.</p>

<p>The "Add emoji reaction" item in the menu doesn't show the ":" as the shortcut for some reason.  The option to "Mark as unread from here" shows the hotkey as "U" instead of shift-U.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first part seems like a bug/omission; the second is intentional; the popovers design at present does not have space for <code>Shift</code> <code>U</code>, so those are case-sensitive pending a redesign of the popover visuals to support the more explicit keyboard shortcut hint style.</p>

<p>I would file an issue to simply add the the hotkey tip for "Add emoji reaction" in the menu, but I think there's some logic in just omitting it from the menu insofar as you want to de-clutter the menu and continue to keep "Star message" out of the menu.  (And, again, I am just agreeing with Vlad here.)</p>

<p>I agree with the concern that the menu is getting long already, enough to diminish the discoverability of all the items in it.</p>

<p>I went ahead and fixed up the internationalization tests, too, including the French example. I hope that wasn't an overzealous fix, but I'm guessing the translation files will take time to reflect this?</p>
