<li>We could provide a way to collapse some views the way Gmail does it with labels. Slack also does that and 1 point. Details to be designed...</li>
<li>Right now we have 1 stream group with a name STREAM but we could provide more stream groups as a way to organize big communities/companies.</li>

<p>One of the key interaction questions around having multiple groups parallel to STREAMS is how to handle the filtering behavior -- right now, there's a single filter input under STREAMS, and I think that's probably what one would want, rather than one filter input per category? Not sure.</p>
<p>But I agree that visually, we probably want stream categories to feel like they're at the STREAMS level. Do we know how we want pinned streams to interact with stream categories? I'm not sure whether all pinned streams should be at the very top, or whether you pin within each category, or whether we try to make pinned streams appear twice, once within their category and again at the top. All of these options feel like they have downsides to trade off.</p>

<p>I see the appeal of having the whole region be scrollable; it feels simpler. But I worry about some of the practical implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure it's worth a line of space for a MORE/LESS control to hide a few of the global filters, so I'd prefer we focus on other directions for that detail.</li>
<li>I'm not sure that the "^ UNREAD" indicator addresses the user story for why we want the "All messages" and "Private messages" unread counts to be always visible, which is the situational awareness, without having to click on anything, of whether you have new unread messages, and whether new ones are coming in regularly. (The "All messages" total will be more important in lower-traffic communities). I've seen other products, like Discord, that do a "More unread above/below" thing in their sidebar, and if you've got a moderate number of unreads, it kinda feels useless, because it's always there. Possibly there's a tweak on it that could address it -- like if "12 unread private messages" fit? But that may be unfun to implement around corner cases like scroll positions where part of the "private messages" section is visible.</li>
<li>I feel like "Drafts" and "private messages being accessible with a single click is fairly important to those features feeling usable; having to scroll up potentially past 50 things to get to them likely won't feel good, and I'm not sure users will intuit that clicking "^ UNREAD" is an intended way to get to drafts/recent conversations/etc.</li>
<li>We should keep in mind we're likely to add an Inbox view adjacent to Recent Topics in the sidebar, and it's probably similarly going to be something that some folks want to visit often. (I expect it to be an option for the default view, and so some users will get there via clicking the Zulip logo in the corner, but others might still have Recent Topics as their default view, for example).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Thinking back to my experience with channel management on Slack at my previous job, I think it's really valuable for pinned streams to be their own top section. That makes it possible to implement various kinds of "zero unreads" policies for those streams while managing your other streams in a different way. Having the stream <em>also</em> appear in its assigned category might be a good idea, perhaps with a setting.</p>

<p>One interaction that would need to be thought about if we allow having a stream appear in two places in the sidebar is how to handle the topics being opened while viewing the stream -- right now, it doesn't matter what you clicked on, if you somehow end up viewing stream foo, topic bar, then we show stream foo open in the sidebar and topic bar highlighted. Simplest would probably be to just have it appear open in both places, but I could see that feeling broken in cases where you don't have so many streams that there's a scrollbar at all. Similarly, logic to scroll so the currently selected topic is visible would need to pick which one to scroll to, etc. Not unsolvable, but a consideration for that class of design.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think a rule along those lines (basically, always open just the pinned copy unless you specifically clicked on the other one) would work, and even preserve the present invariant that only one stream can have its topics open at a time (changing that entails some implementation complexity not worth getting into unless we actually want to do so).</p>

<p>Stream groups are big separator of contexts, so I see stream group as a scope. So there is a separate filter per scope. If user wants to search across the hole organization there is a global search, which could be improved to act as a jump to stream/stream group/topic globally</p>

<p>We used to have drafts on the compose box, and we had clear discoverability issues with it only being advertised there.  I'd say that the reaction to moving it to the left sidebar has been that folks feel it's much more discoverable, in part because that's a pattern from other productivity tools like Gmail.</p>

<p>As we were today at our company meeting solving the issue of ordering of streams here are my 50 cents on this topic:<br>
Groups would solve a lot of problems but I don't see much point in closable groups. I would do it like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Groups should be a presonalised thing so I can have my groups, and a coworker can have his groups - like "pinned"</li>
<li>In fact, You can migrate the Pinned streams as a group with the name Pinned</li>
<li>Design wise i would go with current state as it is for the Pinned. so just a this separator with a group name</li>
<li>I can reorder my groups how I want. In the group streams are ordered alphabetically like it is now.</li>
<li>Groups can't be closed, but the list on the left would be scrollable</li>
<li>Muted streams are showed within the group but at the bottom like it is now</li>
</ol>

<li>filtering would stay as it is, and would either collapse the groups into a single list of streams (if its easier) or would also show the group separators. I dont expcet people to have more then 8 groups, althou a limit is not desired, just to imagine the filtered list with separators, that the separators would not require that much space, but i think a collaped list without group would be sufficient</li>

<p>Yeah, stream groups is a feature that we've wanted to have for a while, but would be difficult to fit into the current left sidebar design. To talk a bit about the concrete changes in this proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>The top navigation views area will become collapsable by the user, with a custom collapsed state that has icons on it so you can still access things without expanding it in one click if you like; this is intended to balance the fact that these are very useful views but also take up a decent amount of space.</li>
<li>The current STREAMS section will become collapsible; this is mostly an irrelevant feature until we add stream group support, but in theory, stream groups would be a straightforward setting to add. There'd be an "OTHER STREAMS" section at the bottom if you have at least one stream group and not every stream is in a stream group. (I think stream groups would not be hard to start adding -- a base version would be just a data model and a dropdown in "Manage streams" for which group something is in, and we very much want them for permissions model reasons eventually).</li>
<li>Pinned streams become pinned only within their stream group. This is probably less convenient if you want to have a single place for all the streams you care about across the organization, but is likely more convenient in other settings. (Not an actual change until organizations actually have stream groups).</li>
<li>We're basically going to lose the global "filter streams" widget for organization using stream groups; instead you'll be only able to filter streams within a group, mainly because it's really not clear where to put a filter box otherwise. I think this is OK.</li>
<li>The main always-visible place for unread counts will possibly be on the stream group headings, not "All messages" or "Inbox", since the latter may be collapsed. But we can of course fiddle with this sort of detail.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, I'm super excited for this set of changes. :) I think the collapsible top area, with shortcut buttons in the collapsed state, solves a space vs. access to views challenge we've been pondering for a while.</p>

<p>My thoughts on Tim's summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pinned streams become pinned only within their stream group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This behavior seems good and expected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is probably less convenient if you want to have a single place for all the streams you care about across the organization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We could implement a "Favorites" group for users to add all the streams they personally care about. In the future, this could turn into custom groups.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're basically going to lose the global "filter streams" widget for organization using stream groups.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that's okay. Maybe it would be beneficial to have the opportunity to search for topics using the global search?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main always-visible place for unread counts will possibly be on the stream group headings, not "All messages" or "Inbox", since the latter may be collapsed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We could also show unread counts on the "Views" tab and hide them on hover. However, I'm not sure if it would be beneficial since we already have all the unread counts displayed below in the other groups.</p>

<p>I have a positive overall impression of the left sidebar. It appears simple and not distracting, while still presenting important information clearly.<br>
The grouping of "Views" also allows for some modularity in the left sidebar, which I appreciate. The custom collapsed state is a great addition as it saves space without sacrificing functionality or requiring more clicks.<br>
Additionally, stream groups are a cool feature.</p>
<p>I am also considering the possibility of making the sidebar resizable. Have we discussed any thoughts on how this functionality could be implemented, or is this something we can discuss further at a later time?</p>

<p>Hm, yeah, maybe... We'd have to think about how to distinguish personal stream groups from org-wide ones. (I guess the personal grouping would override the org grouping.) Probably something to consider later, depending on whether we get user requests for it.</p>

<p>Yes, please don’t start that. We are in the process of designing. And there is interactive prototype which I’m refining</p>

Prototype is showing different states at the same time, so it is not fully working side bar and there are some inconsistencies but only to illustrate options.<br>
<a href="https://zulip-sidebar.vladkorobov.repl.co/">Prototype</a> and <a href="mailto:[url](https://replit.com/@VladKorobov/zulip-sidebar)">code</a></p>
<p>I would like to resolve some questions and if needed incorporate them. At this point the prototype is already pretty big and it will take significant time to integrate it into Zulip web app.</p>
<p>Not there:</p>
<ul>
<li>Side bar modal for DMs</li>
<li>Active section highlight (I will discuss this in a separate topic)</li>
<li>Global search across stream groups (don't suggest to do it now because we don't have stream groups and think that we should do some kind of universal jump to streams/topics/users)</li>
<li>Users panel on the left side</li>
<li>additional filtering options for list of topics in a modal (removed tabs since I think we should do it via context menu which would paste prefixes like search does now)</li>
<li>I don't use simple bar because I want thing to work with a regular scroll first... and I'm not sure why we need simple bar at all unless it is about consistent style across platforms and browsers</li>
</ul>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>light/dark mode</li>
<li>collapsable stream groups, including Views and DMs + autofoldable/autounfoldable DMs and Views</li>
<li>stacked sticky headers (make your viewport less high and scroll)</li>
<li>General chat example</li>
<li>Followed topics example</li>
<li>Resolved topics have a checkmark icon</li>
<li>Followed and resolved show both icons... could we prioritize one over another?</li>
<li>Multiline topics (top alignment of icons and buttons)</li>
<li>Counters colorization (we could make it optional)</li>
<li>Hidden counters</li>
<li>Pinned indicator</li>
<li>Add a stream button</li>
<li>max 3 lines for topics</li>
<li>other smaller things I'm not mentioning</li>
</ul>

<p>Cool! I'm liking this direction. A few notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think I like the new 3-dots icon for a group DM; I kinda feel like I'm wanting similar 4-dots/5-dots groups for large groups, as it's kinda helpful to visually see how big those groups are at a glance as it's a lot easier as a reference than reading the list of names ... we could also think about a different design that involved a number.</li>
<li>All messages I think should have the unread count dropped -- we're moving the count that would make sense for it to Inbox. I don't think there's any count that will make sense to attach to that view.</li>
<li>The Drafts count should probably match the starred/scheduled counts -- they're not unread messages, but instead more like those other things.</li>
<li>We use Simplebar for scrollbars in widgets across the app because native Linux/Windows scrollbars are very bulky/ugly in that sort of setting, and also just have different geometry from Mac scrollbars (as they take up space differently), so I think we'll definitely want to use that here as well. (Our motivation for using it is primarily consistency across platforms/browsers, as you guessed).</li>
<li>It looks like the left edge of the names of DM conversations is slightly horizontally misaligned with those for streams/topics; I think it'd be better for them to be aligned vertically, such that there's basically a column for "left sidebar clickable views"?</li>
<li>I like the <code>{</code> grouping the topics in the stream. In the screenshot, I was a bit worried that the topic names won't stand out enough from stream names given identical font, vertical spacing, and horizontal alignment... but in the demo, the background highlighting for the active stream makes that not feel like a concern: <a href="/user_uploads/2/ed/9HbgsCRnYBICpMYHIQctlAmN/image.png">image.png</a><div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/ed/9HbgsCRnYBICpMYHIQctlAmN/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/ed/9HbgsCRnYBICpMYHIQctlAmN/image.png"></a></div></li>

<p>The reason a number of people can be helpful is that if you've ever been a manager who's in like 7 different group DM conversations with overlapping sets of 5+ people ... well it's one of the few small/compressible details that can help you find the one you're looking for.</p>

<p>Hm, if we don't want to do numbers, I wonder if we could try having scattered-looking dots for 6+ or 7+ participants? Some non-pattern that makes it feel like it's a lot of people, and you aren't supposed to count the dots to figure out exactly how many it is.</p>

<p>One thought that came to mind is that when a section is partially visible, is it more important to view the top or bottom of that section?</p>
<p>However, I'm not sure the scrolling behavior would work in an expected way if it held the top visible while scrolling, instead of hiding the top first.</p>

<p>Scattered dots could work, but the numbers are probably better. I also don't want to spend much time on design for that indicator DM groups with 7+ users; it's a rare corner case and I think it'll be obvious that it's not an unread count based on the position etc.</p>

<li>"STREAMS MAIN" / "STREAMS LONDON" don't feel grammatical as labels for stream groups and doesn't leave much space for the variable input. I think we should just have "STREAMS" (if stream groups don't exist / are not configured in the organization) or "LONDON" -- whatever the organization typed in as the name for their stream group.<br>

<li>I really like the design choice for "MORE TOPICS" of using color; feels like it solves the puzzle of that always feeling like an out-of-place element. For "BROWSE 135 MORE STREAMS MAIN", I think it can be just "BROWSE 135 MORE STREAMS" -- no need to name the stream group (it's implied by the hierarchy and the UI it will take you to will support browsing other stream groups with few added clicks).</li>

<ul>
<li>The heading in "more topics" for a given stream of "STREAM TOPICS" doesn't feel right. We have "BACK TO STREAMS" today, which kinda avoids trying to title the view, and I don't think is a good solution. Maybe just "ALL TOPICS" would be OK? We could also think about renaming the button to get here to "ALL TOPICS" as well <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span>. I checked the code and it is in fact every topic that exists in the stream that you can access. Or another idea we could ponder is using "ALL TOPICS" to open the view but having just the decorated stream name be the heading row -- once it's this overlay styling, I don't feel the need to have a title row for the overlay at all. (We'd have to figure out how to place the X, but pushing the <code>vdots</code> in a bit might work).<br>

<li>I think we should cut the "Add a stream" button at the bottom. It's a pretty active button -- not as loud as "Send" but louder than the reply buttons. And it's redundant -- "Browser N more streams" seems like an intuitive place (and if you're on every stream, that already says "Create a stream"). And the new organization state, where your organization has just 2 streams and you're subscribed to both, your sidebar is going to look like this (well I guess the first one will say "Create a stream" too, perhaps), which I think won't feel nice:<br>

<li>The purple background part of the hover state over \vdots feels really high emphasis for something your mouse might drift over.

<li>I don't like the "shrink on click" animation for the sidebars; having the side icons, text, and unread counts all move inwards on click feels like it draws your attention, where we in fact want to make it easy for your attention to immediately move to the actual message feed you're opening. I think the bold appearing is sufficient indication that the click worked. So I propose dropping the "shrink on click" animation for this, and conceptually I think that reasoning might apply to similar elements (E.g. a full row in a popover that might have icon, label, and keyboard UI hint).</li>

<li>The <code>[</code> around the topics within a stream looks nice, and I think the reduced width of the hover region for topics to avoid overlapping it works well.

I think a good solution would be for the bottom of the brace to only go as far right as the top does -- the brace will be more symmetric and I think it'll fix this interaction.<br>

<li>With the larger font in the sidebar, it feels a bit cramped for horizontal space, both for topic names but also for the space between the names in label rows like VIEWS, DIRECT MESSAGES, etc. We should consider making the left sidebar a bit wider in this design pass.</li>

<p>(Also worth mentioning that we may want to increase the maximum length of topics from 60 characters after the design supports line-wrapping longer ones; though I think we'd still have hints in the compose box discouraging very long topics; the extra length would mainly be for topics generated by integrations like the title of a GitHub issue)</p>

<li>I find it a bit difficult that the "active stream" color is identical to the "hovered stream" color (which adds a border as well). I think it's really important that if your eyes glance at the sidebar while the active conversation is visible, that it draws your attention in an unambiguous way, and having two rows that look almost the same feels like it defeats that. If we want to avoid the current design that uses different colors for those, we could try having the mouse-house behavior be just a border part, without also having the "active stream" background color? My other idea would be to have them be different shades of the same color, with the "active stream" one being higher constrast/stronger.</li>

<p>Another question for you, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="22433">@Vlad Korobov</span>: in working this morning on cleaning and shoring up the layout definitions in the existing left sidebar to pave the way for a smoother implementation of your new design, I was curious about the placement of icons. Here the follow icon (eyeball) sits in the same column as unreads:</p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/60/ceo-iliLjQ-xOo7JP18JhdrH/Screenshot-2023-09-21-at-9.53.27-AM.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/60/ceo-iliLjQ-xOo7JP18JhdrH/Screenshot-2023-09-21-at-9.53.27-AM.png"></a></div><p>Are you thinking that certain icons will just sort of stack up like that? Or will there be dedicated columns for them?</p>

<p>My motivation for asking is that I think it might be smarter to move from the current flex-based layouts to a grid-based layouts on the left sidebar rows. There are a few advantages to that that immediately come to mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>Items, like checkboxes or icons/indicators, can be added and removed at the DOM level without affecting the layout</li>
<li>Especially for things like multi-line topic names and DM groups, we might have better control over the vertical alignment of different elements</li>
<li>The columns of each row can be more precisely sized and controlled at the container level (using things like <code>minmax()</code>) without having to dive into individual children and make different declarations for the flex grow, shrink, and basis properties.</li>
</ol>

<p>I should add that my thinking about this is sort of top-level for each row. Certain elements, like the username/status emoji for one-to-one DMs, would be described as flexboxes. But anywhere we could basically draw a vertical line down the design seems to me to be a candidate for grid.</p>

<p>My current thinking on the UX is that we want them to stack; but if you want to try making a screenshot with the eye not in the unread column, we can see how that looks visually and decide if it's nice.</p>

<p>Sure. And it could be the kind of thing where we've got an icons area in the top-level grid (minus the pin and vdots, which always occupy the same space; same with the checkbox on topics), but the icons themselves are dropped in in a flex container so that we can have better control over the horizontal stacking.</p>

DM rows are currently treated like topic rows, but they're placed in the overall left-sidebar layout similar to stream rows. Once those are done, it'll be onto the header rows as another PR.</p>

<h3>Text response to Tim's feedback</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"STREAMS MAIN" / "STREAMS LONDON" don't feel grammatical as labels for stream</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, no problem, no prefixes/postfixes - better. Alphabetical order?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really like the design choice for "MORE TOPICS" of using color; feels like it solves the puzzle of that always feeling like an out-of-place element. For "BROWSE 135 MORE STREAMS MAIN", I think it can be just "BROWSE 135 MORE STREAMS" -- no need to name the stream group</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure. I used long names in some buttons just to test and show that layout is working the way we want in extreme cases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The heading in "more topics" for a given stream of "STREAM TOPICS" doesn't feel right... Maybe just "ALL TOPICS" would be OK? We could also think about renaming the button to get here to "ALL TOPICS" as well... I checked the code and it is in fact every topic that exists in the stream that you can access. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow, thanks. I thought about it and tried but then in some conversations with Alya we weren't sure that we actually have all topics. Great, I'll rename to ALL TOPICS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't feel the need to have a title row for the overlay at all. (We'd have to figure out how to place the X, but pushing the vdots in a bit might work)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you hit MORE DM CONVERSATIONS you can see that case: <a href="/user_uploads/2/8d/um3MQ2cc-IeRjjpYP8KYrgeY/image.png">image.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/8d/um3MQ2cc-IeRjjpYP8KYrgeY/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/8d/um3MQ2cc-IeRjjpYP8KYrgeY/image.png"></a></div><p>I'm not fan of that layout, but don't have anything better in mind. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think we should cut the "Add a stream" button at the bottom. It's a pretty active button -- not as loud as "Send" but louder than the reply buttons. And it's redundant -- "Browser N more streams" seems like an intuitive place (and if you're on every stream, that already says "Create a stream"). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general we have control of loudness of visual expression of buttons but I agree with you for the solution of having Create when you see all streams and hide that button in 3-dot when there is ALL TOPICS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What feature the "MORE STREAMS DEVELOPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is just a test of long stupid names that I hope will not be in the UI. I tested word-wrapping for those buttons....</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't love the "interleaved view" icon has a rightwards-pointing trapezoid shape</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will propose an alternative. For me it was <code>OK, I'm ready to go all in on this thing and be brave</code>. The challenge is to make it not like "left aligned text" icon</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The purple background part of the hover state over \vdots feels really high emphasis for something your mouse might drift over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I disagree. It is important button which is hidden by default.  3 dots are small, so we do need significant background change to indicate that you hovered on a button inside currently hovered item (think regular people). I suggest to live with this color and later we could dim it a bit. But  we should definitely highlight the whole hit area.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also is it intended that the hover/click area is extra tall for wider messages? I think it could be intended, but would generally prefer just the box around the icon itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tall messages have the full height more button, because it would be strange if you slide it and in some place button isn't working anymore. This right place in 95% cases is  a button and making some 5% cases not a button felt strange. <br>
Its not a problem to make it fixed height but why not have a big button for a big list item?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't like the "shrink on click" animation for the sidebars; having the side icons, text, and unread counts all move inwards on click feels like it draws your attention</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should distinguish click on item vs click on more button vs potentially click on another button in a list item. It is unusual to have click area which isn't fully a button. In physical world buttons can be pressed. I tried background change and it all felt wrong (unnecessary blinking which attracts more attention). <br>
But Animations could be annoying and tuning them requires precision. It is a bit hard with css scale property, but let me tune that and minimize that effect. <br>
In general there is nothing bad to indicate to a person what exactly they clicked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So I propose dropping the "shrink on click" animation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel like it adds good feeling and allows to have not so distinctive background changes... or no background changes at all.<br>
It is expressive and gives a good feedback. I think it makes UI a bit more accessible - user can clearly see what was clicked. <br>
In a loaded interfaces like Zulip it is important. Buttons are almost everywhere here and they are not big usually.</p>
<p>Turning off css scale property is pretty easy, so I suggest to try to live with it and ask people.  Current message buttons have a scale effect and I for now I don't hear people say "can I turn off this animation to avoid motion sickness?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>but I think we need a bit bigger background around the number in the 10 case,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Number 10 is inside 16px circle, as any other icon here is 16px rect. I can make this circle bigger that 16px like this:</p>
<p><a href="/user_uploads/2/3d/sCBl7-l8ow0FZYPtcmVRprUk/image.png">image.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/3d/sCBl7-l8ow0FZYPtcmVRprUk/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/3d/sCBl7-l8ow0FZYPtcmVRprUk/image.png"></a></div><p>So it visually feels same size</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I think the way the hover interaction with "more topics" at the bottom doesn't look great. I think a good solution would be for the bottom of the brace to only go as far right as the top does -- the brace will be more symmetric and I think it'll fix this interaction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is funny that I did struggle to add it <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span>. Without that line it is actually doesn't feel balanced, because MORE button doesn't have an icon:<br>

Removing that element in css is very ease.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The size ratio between the lock and hash icons feels a bit off;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, and i think it is good. Isn't that how importance of those streams work?: </p>
<ul>
<li>Regular stream icon is a usual case and you don't care much</li>
<li>Lock feels bigger (more paint area) because private stream is probably about something more important</li>
<li>Public stream is the whole world... so it is even bigger.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we balance them perfectly an eye would slide so icons wouldn't work as anchor of change.</p>

<p>When in "more topics", the interaction between the fading and the level of contrast in the unread counts make them feel kinda unreadable to me; specifics vary with theme.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorry, man, I don't know how to make not important background readable and at the same time not important and distinctively second layer. The need to see something behind is for now "Tim's feature". It is a modal to pick a topic and the fact that we show so much behind it is already weird:</p>
<p><a href="/user_uploads/2/f3/Ot00zjmaQDWsfLKyKb-ydgon/image.png">image.png</a></p>

<p>With the larger font in the sidebar, it feels a bit cramped for horizontal space, both for topic names but also for the space between the names in label rows like VIEWS, DIRECT MESSAGES, etc. We should consider making the left sidebar a bit wider in this design pass.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree. And I wish sidebar would be resizable. I didn't make it significantly bigger just to test min width...<br>
Sidebar width is 1 css variable, so we can tune it. Here is example of +40px width:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/2/6c/rKBeYelc5uEKgmX1Mvs1BgVC/image.png">image.png</a></p>

<p>I find it a bit difficult that the "active stream" color is identical to the "hovered stream"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep, they are close. We don't want active color to decrease contrast between colored icon and we want other buttons in the row to have good hover effect (they are smaller and it is important for them)<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/2/bb/kmRJEFcZJISyCdctY3VGWg8a/image.png">image.png</a></p>

I spent a lot of time on this, trying different options. Border feel like a best solution. So I suggest to increase the border contrast:</p>

<p>I need to open up a separate thread about this, because there are some inconsistencies with which areas in the left sidebar rows are clickable to chage the narrow—and I think we should probably have the discussion of which areas <em>should</em> be clickable.</p>

<p>I think it makes sense even with multi line messages to keep the controls (check, any markers/unreads, and vdots) to the space of the top line. A bigger area might be nicer on a touch screen device, for finger tapping, but when a pointer is involved with a mouse, it seems excessive to me</p>
