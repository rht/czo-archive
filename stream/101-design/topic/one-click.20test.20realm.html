<p>A proposal for a "one-click test realm", that would allow people to test out Zulip with as little friction as possible. I'm imagining the UX is you click on a button ("Create test organization", or something), and then you're in.</p>
<ul>
<li>It would use a Realm.string_id like <code>test-1321923123</code>, and an email like <code>noreply+1413413513@server-hostname.tld</code>.</li>
<li>You can do everything you can in a normal realm, except change your email (since you can't get the change confirmation email), or log in again once you log out (since you don't know your password). </li>
<li>We can garbage collect these test realms (once a day, or whatever) maybe once the creator logs off, or maybe once there is no one logged into the realm, or maybe we can just say they'll get garbage collected a week after date_created. </li>
<li>It'll be a bit of a hassle to exclude these from analytics (if we want) or /activity, but could be done. </li>
</ul>
<p>There are lots of little bells and whistles, like </p>
<ul>
<li>A fake/cute name and avatar (like "Zulip Tester", and a picture of a multiple choice test)</li>
<li>A nice modal at the beginning explaining "This is a test realm, feel free to whatever you want, it's going to be garbage collected in a week."</li>
<li>A warning if they go through the change-my-email flow</li>
</ul>
<p>etc. but I'm thinking the basic flow shouldn't be too hard.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>I think it could be cool, but also a lot of work.  I'd probably GC after a week, since that's a lot clearer to users.</p>

<p>I think we'd want to have a realm flag for whether a realm is one of these, specifically so we can manage handling these specially for features like analytics.</p>
