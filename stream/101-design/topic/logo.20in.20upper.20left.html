<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-email="brock@zulipchat.com" data-user-id="136">@Brock Whittaker</span>, how do you feel about <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/7995" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/7995">https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/7995</a>? It's a request we've gotten several times.</p>
<p>One reason against would be if we plan on changing the dimensions of the banner that we want users to add in the near or mid future.</p>

<p>Can you explain your reason against it? I read that a couple times over but for some reason couldn't figure out what you mean.</p>

<p>Semi-related to that... are we really sticking with this logo? I think we need to put much more effort on the consistency of the brand (not to sound too corporaty)</p>

<p>Few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>we need to ensure that a single green color is the color we use, we definitely have 4-5 that we use right now</li>
<li>the text often varies - its size, sometimes the font etc</li>
<li>if we had a better icon/logo it could stand better without the text itself</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, Facebook have just their `F' in the upper left, Slack and FB Messenger don't have any logo at all</p>

<p>Also, if we keep the logo to be a single thing, and not a combination of two with custom alignments etc, it would be easier to whitelabel if necessary.</p>

<p>I'm not in love with our current logo, but for Brock: what I mean is that the current slot has space for say a 30px by 200px logo. Let's say we add an option that allows orgs to upload a replacement logo, and we advertize it as roughly a 30px by 200px spot.</p>
<p>Then, say a few months later we change the design of the nav bar area so that now there is only room for a 30px by 100px logo. All of our users will now have to go change their uploaded logos, which is a fairly big annoyance (i.e. more likely is that we will just never change the size of that whitespace.)</p>
<p>Or, let's say a few months later we want to change that corner to be a workplace switcher, or settings dropdown, or anything else. I think allowing custom logos there will make it harder to make such a change.</p>
<p>An alternative would be to just use the realm avatar there and put the name of the org in text.</p>

<p>30x200 is a super weird measurement anyways. My thought for this however is simple; let them upload any logo up to a 4:1 ratio (just a tad more horizontal than ours currently), and then we just make our designs around that, which I think is super feasible given that 4:1 means 120px wide, which is quite narrow.</p>

<p>And I think you can always find space in a page to put in a 120px wide logo.</p>

<p>cool, I think that's a fine solution.</p>
