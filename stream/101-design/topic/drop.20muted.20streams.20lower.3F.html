<p>The muted streams are somewhat distracting when caught up, since their unread counts clutter the right half of the left sidebar. Would it make sense to push them to the bottom of the middle ("Regular streams") section?</p>
<p>One cost is that people are more likely to mute streams and forget about them, which will slowly degrade the rest of their experience on zulip. (Potentially I would argue that we shouldn't make UserMessage rows for muted streams at all, and just load/create those rows live when someone actually clicks to view a muted stream, though I imagine that is a much bigger project.)</p>

<p>I like the current situation.  I have streams that I mute, but which I'm definitely quasi-interested in, and I like to know when I fall too far behind.  I actually want the opposite thing--I want the list of streams to stay stable, with the exception of pinning, and I feel it's a misfeature to push dormant streams down in the list.</p>
