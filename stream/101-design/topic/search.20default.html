<p>Hey! When a user does a search, by default we limit it to their history, and offer the following tip when the user scrolls to the top (example search: "foobar"):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>End of results from your <a href="help/search-for-messages#searching-shared-history">history</a>. Consider <a href="#narrow/streams/public/search/foobar">searching all public streams</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why is that? What are the reasons not to search the entire history by default?</p>

<p>Because the default search searches your PMs and private streams as well, and only searches things you actually received.  If you're in only a few streams in a large public organization, the "all public streams" search is going to have 90% of the results be things you never saw, which would make it very hard to find something that you specifically remember seeing.</p>

<p>Hmm, and I guess even searching the full history of the streams you are a member off can interleave things you've never seen if you joined some streams recently...</p>

<p>This makes me wonder if there'd be any benefit in somehow including "streams I was in", which I assume aren't included right now?<br>
(given never-subscribed, subscribed, and was-subscribed categories?)</p>

<p>Hmm, interesting.  I think that could certainly be implemented; I'm not sure whether it's useful <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span>.</p>

<p>That's based on the idea that searches could incrementally be:</p>
<ul>
<li>current subscriptions (+PMs)</li>
<li>previous subscriptions +above</li>
<li>public-streams +above</li>
</ul>
<p>That gives a mid-way point which is actually more likely in the "I may have seen this message once" group, whereas public-streams are more of a last-ditch search (or I suppose a more general search for something you may have never seen).</p>
