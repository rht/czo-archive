<p>I'm splitting this topic off from <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="101" href="/#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/message.20feed.20borders.20and.20unreads">#design &gt; message feed borders and unreads</a> , since I think it can be self-contained.</p>
<p>What do folks think about the stream color bar removal? It seemed like a cleaner look to me, and I never missed it with how I navigate Zulip (mostly topic-by-topic). Do folks agree that we should aim to move forward with it, possibly after another round of making sure we shake out any glitches?</p>
<p>In terms of getting it rolled out, we have the following potential blocker: </p>

<p>Removing the colored left border also makes it less obvious when the floating recipient bar hasn’t yet updated while scrolling the all messages view. The ideal fix is something like <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/9910">#9910</a>, but without that, this makes the delayed update feel even more buggy.</p>

<p>Is <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/9910">#9910</a> something we could potentially tackle soon after the release?</p>

<p>I would wait until I publish a prototype which we can scroll</p>

<p>This is the colored line to the left of the messages, and it's one of the experiments that got undeployed recently? I'm sorta nervous that it'll be annoying on the realm where I used "All messages" heavily, but I don't think I used CZO in the webapp much when it was deployed, so dunno. I'm curious about other all messages users.</p>

<p>I didn't miss the left side border when it was removed, but I also don't particularly use "All messages" here. The other place one often would see it is in search; I have done a few searches and didn't notice it missing.</p>

<p>There's definitely technical details to work out with positioning and the like if we want to merge removal, as detailed above, but I think the lack of anyone complaining is quite promising for the thesis that the left border is unnecessary and can be removed as part of a redesign.</p>

<p>Do we have a path forward on <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/9910">#9910</a> (or some other version of this PR)? I believe that's what's currently blocking removing the stream color bars on the left.</p>

<p>To clarify, is removal of those bars now an intended part of the redesign?</p>

<p>I wouldn't say that it's decided that they'll be removed, in that this is the kind of change that can not work out when we try it in practice, but it is the current design proposal.</p>

<p>Mm, we <em>have</em> tried it, actually. We'll want to test it again once the issue  <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/9910">#9910</a> is meant to fix has been addressed.</p>

<p>OK, good to know. I remembered reading &amp; responding way back, but I think I missed the follow-up and didn't see the test-deploy.</p>
<p>I know there has been debate about removing excess coloring according to some feedback, but the colors of streams add a nice touch for me, which while would be maintained with just the stream/topic headers, is nicely emphasized with the hanglines.</p>
<p>I'm sure an alternative visual chunking of adjacent messages could work, I've just not seen it in action - and I like the colors right now :)</p>
