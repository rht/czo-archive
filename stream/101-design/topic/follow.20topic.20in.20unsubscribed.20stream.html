<p>So, I was doing some testing in the dev environment for when we change user roles from guest to member (and vice versa). And I noticed that currently the UI for following topics in the message header bar of the web app appears if I look at a public stream that I'm not subscribed to.</p>

<p>For example, in the dev environment, log in as Iago and browse all streams. Select a public stream Iago isn't subscribed to and view the stream (<code>Shift</code> <code>V</code>). Iago can now follow a topic in the stream view via a message header bar without suscribing to the stream.</p>

<p>I feel like we shoul probably not have that option displayed until the user subscribes to the stream? Or some other warning/note that following a topic in an unsubscribed stream won't do what you think it might. For example a person might think they would get notifications about new messages in the topic of the unsubscribed stream, which of course they wouldn't.</p>

<p>That sounds correct to me. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="22341">@Prakhar Pratyush</span> can you take care of tweaking that? I think just the whole widget should be hidden for streams you're not subscribed to.</p>

<p>Do we plan to add an API level restriction too? </p>
<p>Probably not, because in that case we would need to change the topics state to "Default" when a user unsubscribes a stream.</p>
<p>If a user unsubscribe by a mis-click then they would lose all of their topic states for that topic. Currently they just need to subscribe back to the stream.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think this should be a UI-level thing -- just hiding confusing UI for an option that doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>I believe the API won't allow changing visibility policies for streams you're not subscribed to except to remove them.</p>

<p>Currently, it allows to change visibility policy (not restricted to remove).</p>

<p>Oh yeah that's true, as long as you can access the stream. I think that's fine.</p>
