<p>I think there's something about having a PM conversation on Zulip that feels less personal/immediate than having that same conversation on gmail or facebook chat. Do other people feel this as well?</p>
<p>My hypothesis is that we don't have the animation quite right for sending a PM. Sending to a stream I think is fine, as is receiving a PM. <br>
Thoughts?</p>

<p>Is the animation for sending to PMs currently any different than sending to streams?</p>

<p>I think it's the same, it's just more noticeable to me in PMs.</p>
