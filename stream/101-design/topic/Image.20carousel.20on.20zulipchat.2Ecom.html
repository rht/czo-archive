<p>I think this was intentional but I don't like how the bottom of the carousel on <a href="http://zulipchat.com">zulipchat.com</a> blends into the background. There are probably several reasons why I don't like it, apart from just simply being a little unaesthetic to my eyes eg the fact that it doesn't properly isolate the contents of the box means your eyes (your focus) also just tend to... drop out of the frame and get distracted?</p>

<p>I agree with Tim. Definitely room for improvement.</p>
<p>I consider this an important detail, and normally I would be jumping to fix it. But we’re in a rebranding effort that’s in progress but still in early planning stages. It’s possible, maybe even likely, we’ll be using a different approach in the near future for the homepage. So I’m not inclined to put a whole lot of energy into fixing this if it is going to be changed in the near future anyway.</p>
<p>My longterm plan is to communicate what’s in the carousel with a short animated video in the near feature. As well as focus on the benefits of Zulip without necessarily naming our competitors.</p>
<p>Perhaps a better discussion to have is what would be a better way to communicate this information than what we have now? How can we quickly tell others how Zulip is an effective more productive communication tool that can create value for them?</p>
<p>My thoughts are pivoting to something that is mobile first in design principles, looks great on mobile, and desktops. I like the simplicity of what one of our competitors <a href="https://rocket.chat">https://rocket.chat</a> has done as an example. </p>
<p>Really want to optimize for new signups, and free trials for Zulip Cloud, as well as clearly communicate the benefits of Zulip vs. comparing it to other solutions. Not sure a carousel is necessary (but ultimately a decision hasn’t been made yet to not have a carousel). I also want to build a series of several different landing pages targeting different audiences with slight tone and design variations for different audiences.</p>
<p>I really love the under water theme of the Zulip website, and actually want to nudge it a step further. Visually, I think we can do something graphically pleasing while still keeping the same simplicity. My intention is to keep a similar color scheme to what we have now but maybe a tad bit more blue like our recent ad campaign (the colors are currently used on our site anyway but not uniformly).</p>
<p>Do you have any thoughts on how we can improve our homepage design overall? What should we consider during our rebrand?</p>

<p>Well... I'm not sure I have anything overall but I often have a few bad ideas for specific small places, <br>
so, just throwing these out here, not saying they're good or actionable:</p>
<ul>
<li>One concept I have is an animation with an octopus, kinda like <a href="/user_uploads/2/37/AeIQnH0Iet-O48Mr7QwwiJmw/octopus.jpeg">this one</a> except it's looking at ~3 different monitors (with maybe ~2 on the ground instead of the table) and has ~2 phones in it's hands, and it's eyes dart between the screens and the tentacles wobble a little to show that it's working on all these different devices simultaneously. I'd put it on the left with right aligned text saying "Zulip, the only etc etc".<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/37/AeIQnH0Iet-O48Mr7QwwiJmw/octopus.jpeg" title="this one"><img src="/user_uploads/2/37/AeIQnH0Iet-O48Mr7QwwiJmw/octopus.jpeg"></a></div></li>
<li>We could also add a bit of motion to things we want to be eye catching, so, eg the "open source" chest could pop open and the fish could swim out.</li>
<li><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="9809">@Tejas Tank</span> had an intresting idea for a preloader to the site.</li>
<li>The nav could be changed to be, well, a sticky nav.</li>
<li>I saw this <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/6237098-Quiksilver-Surfing-Home-Page">wave transition on dribble</a> which we probably can't use... but I suppose the concept is an idea? Waves and tides?<ul>
<li>Ah, the feature page does try!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
