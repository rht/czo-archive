<p>So, in <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/22893">#22893</a> / <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="378" href="/#narrow/stream/378-api-design/topic/mark-as-unread.20request">#api design &gt; mark-as-unread request</a>, we will be adding a new API for bulk-marking messages as read/unread. We will be able to use this to replace the existing "Mark all messages as read" feature, which currently has a pretty poor user feedback story.</p>
<p>In the common case, the new API will just do what you asked, and we may not need feedback UI. </p>
<p>But if you are asking to mark many thousands of messages as read/unread, it may take longer, and we probably need to notify the user about the status of their request somehow. What we'll be have from the API endpoint is:</p>
<ul>
<li>What the earliest and latest messages that've been processed are, and their timestamps.</li>
<li>How many total messages have been modified.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will not know how many total messages the user asked to modify; computing that is too expensive.</p>

<p>One option for this is use the top-of-app banner feature we already have, that is currently used for things like the notice you get when the browser can't reach the Zulip server:</p>
<p><a href="/user_uploads/2/5a/Fr1LFZ_anEfGLEsh-iWjsUsX/image.png">image.png</a> </p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/5a/Fr1LFZ_anEfGLEsh-iWjsUsX/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/5a/Fr1LFZ_anEfGLEsh-iWjsUsX/image.png"></a></div><p>And have text for that of the form "Marked 10231 messages as unread between Jan 2, 2021 and July 7, 2022", and update the numbers/dates every time we process a batch of messages. We can probably tune the size of batches such that it updates every few seconds, and I'm imagining it should disappear on successful completion. (And I imagine we'd only show this banner at all in cases where we need to do multiple matches of 1K+ messages).</p>
<p>Another option is to pop up a modal; I'm not thrilled with that option in that it's kinda in your face.</p>

<p>We need a design for this that's quick in that we're probably only going to have a couple days to implement it; so that's one reason using the existing banner system might be appealing. </p>

<p>I think a banner seems fine... A modal prevents users from doing other things in the meantime; my understanding is that they can keep using Zulip without interrupting the process.</p>

<p>Marking all messages as read... X messages sent before January 2, 2022 have been marked as read so far.<br>
Marking all messages in #stream as read... X messages sent (etc.)<br>

<p>We should make sure there's a delay before we show the banner at all, so that we don't flash it unnecessarily. (I'm not sure what the right amount of time to wait is.)</p>

<p>Playing with it with my alternate account on CZO, I think we should fix the fact that the first batch size is N+1, making all the message counts on the update banner end in 1. It really makes it look like the counter is buggy (which it's not, but that's how it makes it seem).</p>

<p>Looking at the server logs, I don't see any server requests that took longer than 1.1s for that account. So probably it was a networking delay when it got stuck, or maybe just the range; some batches were as fast as 250ms.</p>

<p>Yeah I'm pretty sure this is a frontend live-update performance issue when marking a ton of messages unread at once. We can investigate with profiling, but probably not a big deal if we fix this in 6.1.</p>

<p>OK, for mark-as-unread, with recent topics visible, it's <code>recent_topics_ui.inplace_rerender</code> which we're calling for each newly unread message; probably we just want to switch to a full rerender of recent topics, at least if there's more than 10 messages in the event.</p>

<p>We have a similar issue with mark-as-read, but that'll require more care, since we definitely don't want to do a bulk operation when processing  small number of messages being marked as unread.</p>

<p>Merged <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/14e14c4d35cac002d9b59a8a7e6f64b70418227f">14e14c4d35cac002d9b59a8a7e6f64b70418227f</a> to fix this in the mark-as-unread code path. We should open follow-up issues for optimizing the UI updates for both bulk mark-as-unread and bulk mark-as-unread, since I don't think either would be super hard to make efficient.</p>

<p>So I think we have two outstanding details here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Batch sizes. Ideally, I think we want the browser to request 1000 total (999 + the anchor) for its first batch and 2000 for batches after that, or something like it.</li>
<li>The issue with muted streams not being fully covered in the "mark all as read" code path.</li>
</ul>

<p>I can take care of batch sizes part right now.</p>
