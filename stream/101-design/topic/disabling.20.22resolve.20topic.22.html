<p>Hey! There's an organization that is interested in being able to disable "resolve topic". What are folks' thoughts on that feature?</p>
<p>If we think it's valuable, perhaps the right concept is to have an org-level default, and then a stream-specific setting for whether resolve topic is on or off?</p>

<p>Part of the motivation for the request, by the way, is that we do have a <em>lot</em> of polish issues for this feature. It's a good chunk of the <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22release+goal%22">"release goal" label</a>.</p>
<p>This may be a separate thread, but are we on a good path towards addressing this bundle of work?</p>

<p>My vote is to add the org setting.  Even if it's polished I could see orgs wanting to disable it</p>

<p>I think this is a reasonable feature -- some classes of organizations may not want this workflow.  </p>
<p>Ideally it'd be a stream-level setting, so I think we should make this work like other organization-level settings that are default for streams where it hasn't been overriden.  Thoughts?</p>

<p>would it cascade? as in, disabled org-wide but a stream can opt in, or enabled org-wide but a stream can opt out?</p>

<p>Yeah, we have several other settings that work this way, and I think that's the correct model for this case as well.</p>

<p>I also suspect we want the setting to be "Which roles/groups can resolve/unresolve topics in this stream", with "nobody" being a possible option, since this is naturally the kind of thing where a permission would be appropriate..</p>

<p>What other ones do you have in mind? I'd like to take a look to make sure we're consistent in how it's communicated when writing up the issue.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="19257">@Alya Abbott</span> hmm, this seems to propose just a boolean, not a "which roles.groups can resolve topics" model.  I think we're eventually going to want the groups-based approach.</p>

<p>Oh, hm, that's a good point. I can change the drop-downs described in the issue to specify roles instead.</p>
<p>Once we have our new groups infrastructure, we'll have to rethink all those role drop-downs in general.</p>

<p>I think there's a good chance we'll have the groups infrastructure in place such that new settings can use it in 2-3 weeks.  It will likely take longer to figure out how to migrate existing settings, since that has API considerations we need to think about.</p>
