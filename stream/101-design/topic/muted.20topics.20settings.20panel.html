<p>I would like to start a discussion around the changes in the <a href="#settings/muted-topics">"Muted Topics" settings panel</a></p>
<p>Current UI: <a href="/user_uploads/2/76/Hfnkt0agTrF5OHqhOVShplbH/Screenshot-from-2023-04-05-01-05-08.png">Muted Topics UI</a></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Renaming "Muted Topics" in the sidebar to:<br>
     a. Personal preferences for a topic; or<br>
     b. Topics configuration<br>
     c. or simply; "Topics"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Renaming the panel header "Muted Topics" as:<br>
    a. Topics configuration<br>
    b. Topics with special configuration</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(In the future we can add other things (other than visibility_policy) regarding "personal preferences for topics" in this UI with respective panel headers)</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>The <strong>Date muted</strong> column header should be updated as:<br>
"Date muted" to "Date added" (Here "added" signifies, the date on which configuration was added.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Actions:</strong><br>
a. toggle effect: mute/remove-mute, unmute/remove-unmute, and so on.<br>
b. dropdown to select any visibility_policy: MUTE/UNMUTE/ no special config (i.e. INHERIT)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updating the search bar to support filtering by other visibility_policy</p>
</li>
<li>Update the search bar placeholder text.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think, "Date added" or "Date updated" would make sense, depending on whether we plan to use a "toggle effect" or "dropdown" (as discussed in the 4th  point).</p>
<p>"toggle effect": "date added"<br>
"dropdown": "date updated"</p>

<p>Just "Topics" seems OK to me (though not entirely ideal). The panel names are generally noun phrases, so it could be something like "Configured topics", but that doesn't really seem to clarify it it to me.</p>

<p>We should also change the sidebar icon. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="22433">@Vlad Korobov</span> do you have a suggestion for what to use? This is a settings panel that will list all topics with a special configuration -- muted topics, unmuted topics, followed topics.</p>

<p>Keeping the heading structure consistent, I think "Configured topics" seems fine here. We may also want to add a line of description above the table to give a bit of an explanation about what's going on in this panel.</p>

<p>Yeah, probably the clearest UI would be to have a Status column (just after the Topic column), with a dropdown set of options (Muted, Unmuted, (later) Followed, Default). And then we can just drop the Actions column. If I recall correctly, we expect to have at most one special config set per topic?</p>

<p>Sounds good. I think visually this could be similar to <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/24671">#24671</a>. It seems OK for this to be a follow-up, rather than part of the initial implementation.</p>

<p>I guess "Filter topics" would work there. It could be "Filter configured topics", but the extra word probably doesn't add much.</p>

<p>"Topic settings" would also be a possible candidate name; maybe a bit more consistent with the rest of our UI naming conventions than "Configure topics"?</p>

<p><strong>I said:</strong></p>
<p>In the status dropdown, the three options (Muted, Unmuted, Default) should always be present?</p>
<p>Example to explain:</p>
<p>Let's say a topic has the status MUTED and is in an unmuted stream. Should we provide the option of UNMUTE in the dropdown? (which will result in UNMUTED topic in the unmuted stream)</p>
<p>Possible ways to handle this:</p>
<p>a. Let the user select any option; we will handle the resultant behaviour when working on the display aspects PRs of this feature.</p>
<p>b. Don't show the option. -- (I think this is the correct way.)</p>

<p>Yeah, I think that's right. Otherwise, it will probably be confusing for the user (what does unmuting a topic that's in an unmuted stream mean?).</p>
<p>I guess we might still end up showing all 3 options in order to display the current state, e.g. if:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user umutes a topic in a muted stream. -&gt; unmuted topic, muted stream</li>
<li>The user then unmutes the stream. -&gt; unmuted topic, unmuted stream</li>
</ol>
<p>Is that right?</p>

<p>But as long as we handle UNMUTED topics in not-muted streams correctly (which we do), I think it's fine to not always maintain this truth -- for example, I think it would be OK to avoid doing things like cleaning up UNMUTED topics whenever a stream is unmuted. Doing so would also break workflows for people who frequently mute/unmute streams (I'm not sure if there is a genuine use case for doing so though).</p>

<p>So, I think:</p>
<p>In the topics table, we should exclude the topics having <code>UNMUTED</code> status and being in an unmuted stream.</p>
<p>In the  new PR <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/25127">#25127</a>, the behavior is:<br>
When you select the status as default, the topic is removed from the table (as it doesn't have any special configuration).</p>
<p>Similarly, we should treat the <code>UNMUTED</code> topic in an unmuted stream as being <strong>not a special configuration</strong> (so we drop it from the table).</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>I think once we add "follow topic", we're going to have 4 possible values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow topic</li>
<li>Never mute topic / Unmuted</li>
<li>Default for stream (help text would explain the topic is treated as muted only if the stream is muted)</li>
<li>Mute topic</li>
</ul>
<p>We've been trying to avoid/defer doing UI for that in the many existing places in the app where we currently display a toggle for this "Unmute topic" feature, because without the "Follow topic" option, it'd feel like pretty silly/contorted UI to have a 3-item dropdown menu where 2 of them do the same thing for most intents and purposes the user is going to think about. </p>
<p>But I think we shouldn't do a bunch of extra work to avoid just offering those 3 options in this dedicated "Topics" panel, where we do have the space to explain the options -- it'd be better to build something where you pick one of those 3 options for that context and then not have to redo it when we add "follow topic" in a few months.</p>

<p>I think it will be helpful to figure out how we want to explain the "Unmuted" state -- maybe the above problem is something we can solve with some care around language -- but I think I'd rather avoid the extra work of things like hiding <code>UNMUTED</code> topics in streams that are currently not muted; it seems probably more confusing to conceal the state that the user has configured, I think?</p>

<p>That reasoning makes sense to me. If we don't have the space for more than basic labels in the dropdown, we can add an explanation above the table.</p>

<p>Ok,</p>
<p>Should I add the following text?</p>
<p>Topics with status:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MUTED</strong>: Topics are displayed faded, with no notifications, and not included in the unread count total.</li>
<li><strong>UNMUTED</strong>: Topics will remain visible even if the stream is muted. In a stream that is not muted, a status of UNMUTED has the same behavior as DEFAULT.</li>
<li><strong>DEFAULT</strong>: Topics will inherit the stream's behavior. Topics are treated as muted only if the stream is muted.</li>
