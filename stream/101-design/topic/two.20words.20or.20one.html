<p>There are several places we teach users about topics (and we'll probably add a few more over time): hotspots, /help, the second day email we send out, etc. In that advice, should we recommend topics are "2-3 words", or "1-3 words"? </p>
<ul>
<li>The benefit of the first is that I think most one word topics (especially by new folks) are not good topics, and it would have been better if they had been slightly more descriptive.  I rarely write one word topics myself.</li>
<li>The benefit of the second is that it feels more flexible for new users (they can feel comfortable just using a topic like "hello"), and there are instances where a one word topic is the right thing (e.g. "meeting", "priorities", "introductions").</li>
</ul>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>1-3 is my vote</p>

<p>One thing that pushes me toward "2-3 words", or even something longer -- note this topic is 4 words :) -- is that a common new-user confusion is to think of "creating" a topic as a heavyweight action, that requires permission (at least social permission). One-word names, like typical stream names, occupy a fat area of namespace, so if you think of topics as likely one word, then that may reinforce a confusion where you think that a new topic means seizing some prime namespace that you'd better not do unless you're really confident. But if you think of topics as typically being several words, then that doesn't fit together with that misunderstanding and you're more likely to shift to the "email subject line" analogy and get the idea better.</p>

<p>I basically agree with Greg's reasoning here, so a 2-to-3 words recommendation is fine by me.  I'm kind of curious how many newbies resist topics due to etiquette concerns ("don't seize the namspace") vs. simple ignorance (don't even know what they are) or understandable laziness (too much of a pain to start a new topic).</p>

<p>Would measuring the stats for the number of words in topics in this realm reveal which one happens more often: one-word or two-word topic?</p>

<p>I voted for 1-3 because we have plenty of legitimate 1-word topics on this realm.  See "scrolling" as a recent example.</p>

<p>You can click on "more topics" in the sidebar to do advanced analytics, haha. <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" src="/static/generated/emoji/images/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" title="smile"></p>

<p>The best topic names are generally 2-3 words, though, so I think it's fine to make that the recommendation, for the concerns that Rishi/Greg brought up.</p>

<p>I just eyeball-measured for this stream:<br>
1 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br>
2 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br>
3 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br>
4 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br>
So it is 2-word (at least for #design). This may depend on the language tho, e.g. in a lang where phrases are connected into one word, one-word will occur more often.</p>

<p>interesting point about the language!</p>
<p>Greg's point resonates with my experience. I hadn't thought about the seizing namespace aspect, but makes a lot of sense. I think the reason to go not too long is that the other failure mode I've seen is people putting topics that are email subject line in length. Though possibly that should just be solved with a 60 character limit in the topic input box.</p>

<p>I guess that data set suggests that "1-4 words" may be an accurate summary.</p>
