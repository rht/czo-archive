<p>While designing mobile flows I realized that I want a feature... So I'll start from the far. </p>
<p><strong>I'm on web desktop and I want to mark a topic as read without actually reading it.</strong> <br>
Why? Because I have to follow that stream to communicate with people inside it or there might be an actual topic I'm interested in. (I know that <strong>follow a topic</strong> feature request is already in the github) </p>
<p><strong>I have 2 options</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click more button and pick <code>Mark all messages as read</code>. But it is not easy, it requires aiming to <em>more</em> button and aiming to menu item, and I don't want to do that 5-10 times in a row.<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/2/25/k6oC3qvUw1O3qDUF-Wm84OtH/image.png">image.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/25/k6oC3qvUw1O3qDUF-Wm84OtH/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/25/k6oC3qvUw1O3qDUF-Wm84OtH/image.png"></a></div></li>
<li>
<p>Scroll down with <code>scroll down arrow</code>. But it placed on the very right corner, so moving from the left side where I pick topic to the right bottom corner isn't great.<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/2/cc/PZxM77wm5_jrYqyrNIhkcGSR/image.png">image.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/cc/PZxM77wm5_jrYqyrNIhkcGSR/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/cc/PZxM77wm5_jrYqyrNIhkcGSR/image.png"></a></div></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>3. I wish there would be a hot key to <code>mark all as read</code></em></strong> – This is a feature request.</p>
<p>But there is more to it. On mobile Zulip I have a great mode which doesn't mark messages as read when I scroll - that is very helpful. We don't have such feature on web and I wish we do. <strong>– This is another feature request.</strong></p>
<p>The current redesigned <code>mark all as read</code> in mobile looks like this: Scroll (you can do it with the arrow) and mark all as read:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/2/bd/E2VROcA6U2724yW9y78bmWyn/image.png">image.png</a> <a href="/user_uploads/2/26/qdgi9ImD5wVZb5MFpLIgFmKu/image.png">image.png</a> </p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/bd/E2VROcA6U2724yW9y78bmWyn/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/bd/E2VROcA6U2724yW9y78bmWyn/image.png"></a></div><div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/26/qdgi9ImD5wVZb5MFpLIgFmKu/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/26/qdgi9ImD5wVZb5MFpLIgFmKu/image.png"></a></div><p>So I thought we could have a special mode switch in settings <code>Don't mark as read with scroll</code> and we could have the same flow on desktop.<br>
And here is a weird question... What if we move the scroll down button to the left side on desktop web?<br>

<p>We could also look at a different shape for it, like a thin horizontal bar; one would probably have a smaller click target vertically, but it might solve that problem. I'm not sure whether at the top or bottom of the view would be visually better.</p>

<p>When I was designing and testing this, if you had the setting set to do not mark messages as read, the compose banner should continue to display. Hence, I decided to hide the banner and resume reading when the user set the setting to mark messages as read. I also thought that when a user decides to turn the setting to mark messages as read, they understand that messages will begin to be marked as read and they're fully commiting to it.</p>

<p>I do see how the user may also want to mark messages as unread and wanting to preserve the unread state before hand. Ensuring that the messages are unread after the user set the setting to mark messages as read.</p>

<p>I think the special not marking unread state on the current view should be preserved. That is, it should be the same as if the setting had been that messages normally get marked read on scroll in the first place.</p>

<p>Just making sure, <br>

<ul>
<li>We want to show the preserved messsage state banner.</li>

<p>Since the last time we talked about this, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="19257">@Alya Abbott</span> decided it was best to create a new custom unread banner that will provide the users with more information about why messages are remaining unread.</p>
<p>Now, I've designed the logic in <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/24309">#24309</a> so that when the user has their Zulip app configured to not mark messages as read and there are unread messages in their message view, the new custom unread banner will appear, which is fine.</p>
<p>But I've also preserved the conditions in when the default unread banner appears. (E.g. marking messages as unread, in a near message view, in search view). The default banner will replace the custom unread banner if it is shown. They are not stacked together as shown below: </p>

<p>I was thinking we should probably just show the banner about the configuration, since from the user's perspective, that's a simple, consistent reason why messages aren't getting marked as read. But open to other suggestions.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/24309">#24309</a> was merged, I am working towards the final piece, only mark messages as read in conversational views. This means that messages will be marked as read only in topic view and messages in any other views will remain unread until the user mnaually marks them as read. </p>
<p>Since a user is able to read messages in the topic view, I'm wondering if it's better to show the "preserved reading state banner" when a user marks a message as unread in the topic view and show the other unread banner when the message is marked as unread in any other views. Or should we keep it simple and just display the "settings set to not mark as read" banner all around?</p>

<p>We should report accurately to the user why their messages aren't being marked as read, as otherwise we'll be causing confusion about what the setting they selected does. So we need to do this:</p>

<p>Yeah it's already working. I've added the <code>update_unread_banner()</code> into <code>narrow.js</code>where we call whenever we are changing views. Thus, the banner is updated every single time we are changing the view and accurately display to the user why their messages aren't being marked as read. I've also addressed the suggestions you've left in the PR. Should be good now <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="7">@Tim Abbott</span></p>

<p>Your Zulip app is configured to mark messages as read on scroll: Only in conversation views.<br>
Your Zulip app is configured to mark messages as read on scroll: Never.</p>
