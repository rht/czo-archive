<p>I was working on the issue for adding a <code>Phone number</code> data type in custom profile fields. I have  raised <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/24294">#24294</a> for the same. In this I have used <a href="https://pypi.org/project/phonenumbers/">Phone numbers</a> for validating the phone number. For a phone number to be  validated  through this package it must have a country code. But <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="19257">Alya Abbott</span>  suggested in the review to not have country code in phone number. So can anyone suggest a package which allows validating a phone number without country code.</p>

<p>One alternative would be supplementing that with a default country with the organization, and later perhaps having groups supply countries or area codes to those in them, to make entering phone numbers easier.</p>

<p>Thanks! This approach sounds pretty reasonable to me. Just want to ask do we currently have a default country associated with an organization so that I can supplement Dialing code of that country.</p>

<p>I don't believe so. That server feature setting would enable autocompletion or a default entry in a drop-down or similar, but could be independent from this.</p>
<p>In terms of the country code specifically, it depends if the text should include the country code when it's in its final form for sending to a client. That sounds like a useful general feature, at least to me, but I'll leave <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="19257">Alya Abbott</span> to answer that.</p>

<p>(Also just a note that you don't need to quote the text - certainly in it's entirety, or even at all - when replying, since my message is above. If you're concerned about making sure people know what you're replying to, you can use a simple silent mention at the start)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="24860">@Ujjawal Modi</span> one possible option would be to insert a <code>+1</code> if a phone number doesn't begin with <code>+</code>. We can later build a feature to have a default country code for the organization if we think that makes sense, but it seems like premature complexity, and I think Americans are the users most likely to enter a phone number without a country code in the first place <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span>.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="7">Tim Abbott</span> It feels like the important thing to clarify here is that you're expecting that the phone number field will contain a country code? (eg. that mobile/terminal receives)</p>

<p>(Anecdotally, I certainly didn't know the UK phone prefix until I started trying to call it regularly from abroad, though that may have changed now.)</p>

<p>Yeah it may be worth doing a bit of research on how others do phone number fields well to decide how to proceed here.</p>

<p>From my comment on the PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some products solve this by having a country dropdown with a reasonable default (probably, US for us)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that would be fine from a UX perspective.</p>
