<blockquote>
<p>I also noticed a bug while working on this, which is that probably the scheduled messages UI should not have a click handler for clicking on a previously scheduled messages unscheduling it and moving it to the compose box; clicking on the message body (and not the edit/delete pencils) should just do nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Drafts also currently work this way, and when I think about it, I usually open the draft by just clicking anywhere on it. Opening a scheduled message for editing is a more "destructive" action, in that it unschedules it. But the time you'd had it scheduled for is offered in the "..." menu, so it's not actually hard to reschedule.</p>
<p>Anyway, I might be inclined to keep the current behavior, where clicking anywhere on a draft or scheduled message opens it in the compose box. Curious what other folks think.</p>

<p>I've not used this feature yet, but could editing it leave the scheduled time in place, but perhaps show the scheduled time and a countdown timer while editing - so that if it's edited within some duration close to the scheduled time, only then does it reset the scheduled time?</p>

<p>We tried keeping the message scheduled originally, but it was way more complicated than the current setup.</p>

<p>On <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/25569">#25569</a>, <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="7">Tim Abbott</span> proposed also adding a compose banner to make it really clear that the message is no longer scheduled. Perhaps something like this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This message is no longer scheduled for &lt;date/time&gt;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess we could show this both when the user opens the message from the "Scheduled messages" UI and when they click "Undo" on the scheduled message confirmation banner.</p>

<p>Yeah I'm ok with that banner approach, I just felt like we need to do something.</p>

<p>Hmm, what's the appropriate color for the banner? Yellow?</p>
