<p>I've had quite a few cases using the windows client where replies in all messages have gone to the wrong conversation, and wondered why I've been making an error. Selecting a message fades messages outside of that conversation, and clicking outside of the chat area resets the fading but still keeps a conversation selected. At that point, hitting reply after seeing a message come in could easily go to the wrong conversation without taking steps to ensure you have the correct conversation as the visual cue for which conversation is active is gone.</p>
<p>This could be avoided if message selection is cleared along with the fading being reset when clicking outside of the conversation area, and replying either auto selected the most recent conversation (which would be the most useful behaviour but perhaps should be an option), or the user clicked a message (presumably the most recent) to again select the conversation.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="17281">@Nick Lindridge</span> I think it's somewhat unlikely that we're going to change this behavior, since it's pretty ingrained in our app to always have a message selection and to assume that if you hit enter/r to reply, our best guess is to choose the message you selected.</p>
<p>Just to clarify one thing, when you say "hitting reply", you mean that you're using the keyboard, correct?</p>

<p>Some possible workarounds to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid "All Messages" to some degree by using the "n" key to navigate to unread messages or "t" for recent topics</li>

<p>hi steve, yes <code>r</code> or <code>enter</code>. An option to auto-move the selection to the most recent reply, perhaps only if there is no filtering/topic focus in play (not sure what you call the concept in Zulip), might be an alternative. As replying applies focus, this would avoid a new message on a different topic switching topic, and the only race condition would be between observing the most recent message and pressing reply to start replying.</p>
<p>Essentially, it would be nice if seeing a message, deciding to reply, hitting reply, writing reply and sending, was the only cognitive effort required and 100% reliable, avoiding the steps of needing to check that the reply is going to the right place each time.</p>

<p>thanks for the <code>end</code> suggestion, this came up as an option when we've been discussing the issue, which has been to some length on a number of occasions now :) I haven't trained myself and already forgotten about it though. </p>
<p>Another feature I couldn't find when trying to correct an incorrect post was a move feature. The only way I could find so far to move a message was copy/paste, and that had its own issues where too much text would be copied (basically more than what was selected), as well as including the user in the selection. So a move message feature would be nice, though I've only needed that to fix posting to the wrong place.</p>

<p>Your problem statement makes perfect sense, but it's just tricky to guess which place to put the cursor after certain actions.  If you are replying to an upscreen message, then click away for some reason, and then we jump you down to the last message, that creates a new class of "mix" possibilities.</p>

<p>For moving messages, you should be able to use the pencil icon in the upper right corner of a message, which lets you edit the topic of a message.  Let me find some docs...</p>

<p>Ideally, we try to prevent mixes altogether, which is why we try to show the cursor outline somewhat prominently, and which is why we do "compose fade", but prevention isn't always possible without us introducing extra inconvenience (like "are you sure this is the topic?") or visual clutter (making it more obvious which message is being replied to).  And then the fallback is to just edit the stream/topic.</p>

<p>That works to edit, but I think it's just freeform text and you can't select an existing topic. Haven't tried pasting an existing one in though. </p>
<p>Replying and clicking away creates a draft, so selecting the last message on a new reply at that point would probably still be ok, and then going back to the draft would select the related conversation again, protecting from auto select behaviour. There might be cases where it is an issue as you said.</p>

<p>I just opened <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/16368">https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/16368</a> for that.  I am surprised we have never implemented that, or that I have never noticed it.

<p>It wouldn't be crazy to allow you to drag a message to a topic in the left sidebar, either.  I think we mostly avoid drag/drop in our UI, but I don't if that's a philosophical decision we've made, or if it's simply just a type of feature that we haven't invested time in polishing yet.  I suspect it's mostly the latter.</p>

<p>My personal opinion is that we should consider spliting up the edit-message-content feature from the move-topic feature, instead of combining them in the same dialog under the same menu option, as we do now.  But I think it might be a tough sell at this point.</p>

<p>Just to be clear about drag/drop, I would only consider that supporting it in addition to other options.  And you obviously want to be somewhat careful about drag/drop interfaces, since accidental mouse swipes can be very confusing if you're overly aggressive about supporting drag/drop.</p>

<p>As a general comment, I'm glad we switched away from Skype for chat. Zulip is a massively better experience and far more suitable for us.</p>
