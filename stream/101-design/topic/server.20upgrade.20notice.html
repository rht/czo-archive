<p>Hi folks! Not all server administrators subscribe to our announcement list or blog, or follow us on Twitter, so it's very possible for admins to be unaware when a new Zulip release comes out. We'd like to start showing a banner in the web app on self-hosted servers to encourage server admins to upgrade to the most recent stable release version, which has all the latest improvements and bug fixes (including security fixes).</p>
<p>There are a bunch of questions about how best to communicate this message in a way that's helpful (and not too annoying ;). Here are some points for discussion:</p>
<ol>
<li>Who should see a banner (e.g. admins? everyone?)?</li>
<li>What should the banner(s) say?</li>
<li>How dismissable should the banner(s) be?</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that some of the answers to these questions could vary depending on how old the server version (e.g. prior stable release series vs. older).</p>
<p>For reference, we <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/blob/v27.182/src/common/ServerCompatBanner.js#L53-L64">show a banner in mobile apps</a> at startup for <em>very</em> old server versions.</p>
<ul>
<li>For admins: '{realm} is running Zulip Server {serverVersion}, which is unsupported. Please upgrade your server as soon as possible.'</li>
<li>For non-admins: '{realm} is running Zulip Server {serverVersion}, which is unsupported. Please contact your administrator about upgrading.'</li>
</ul>

<p>For (1), I think a nice touch is to start showing it to admins some time (like a week) before showing it to other users. That way, if the admins are on top of getting the server upgraded, their users never see the banner.</p>

<p>For (3), for reference, our current answer in mobile is that you can dismiss the banner, and it comes back the next time the app starts up (if it still applies.)</p>

<p>Yeah, so I think the new thing to do here may be basically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add some plumbing for the server to actively learn when there's a new version, and perhaps also a couple of bits of metadata (like "this is a security update", or in the opposite direction "this is an installer-only bugfix") that influence how important it is to take the upgrade.</li>
<li>Make a banner that we show much sooner than we show the existing one.</li>
</ul>

<p>The existing banner is quite conservative in when it shows. That's largely because the logic behind it has no information on whether there actually is a new release to update to, so it just waits until it's been such a long time that there must surely be important updates by now.</p>

<p>Then the design question is: if we're showing a banner much sooner -- for example, immediately after we put out a new release with a security fix -- then what should it look like? I don't remember what our existing banner looks like, but it may be rather red and stern. For this situation, we'd want a gentler design, at least when it first appears.</p>

<p>Would you like show such a banner for instances of the <code>main</code>-branch, too? Because sometimes I deliberately wait for certain features or fixes.

<p>And yeah, the gear icon area sounds like a good spot.</p>
<p>I do kind of want to show it for non-admin users too, if it stays out of date for a while.</p>
<p>I think in many orgs there may be very few admins and they may be quite busy; and probably in some orgs the admins aren't even active users of Zulip (e.g. they're the IT department), or perhaps are using some client that isn't showing them the warnings. So if they don't get to it for a while, I think it's healthy for other users to be made aware that it's out of date so they can bug the admins to get it upgraded.</p>

<p>(Even the org admins may not have any more direct way to act on the warning than any other user does -- they may not be the people who have access to the underlying server, so the way they act on the warning may be to go bug the people who do.)</p>

<p>I think having an "Update" button next to the gear menu, even if just takes you to documentation about how you're out of date or something, would be a nice way to make this visible without being as heavy as the fullscreen banner. Though we need to be careful when showing it to non-administrators about messaging -- they also need to update the desktop app, and I could imagine that being confusing for folks who don't know what a server is.</p>
