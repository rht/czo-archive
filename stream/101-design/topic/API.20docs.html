<p>Hey folks, exciting news!  We now have a version of the replacement for /api that should be possible for several people to collaborate on.  It's based on the /help/ site infrastructure and is available at /api-new/: <a href="https://chat.zulip.org/api-new/" target="_blank" title="https://chat.zulip.org/api-new/">https://chat.zulip.org/api-new/</a></p>
<p>Obviously a lot more work is needed to make this good: </p>
<ul>
<li>Adding a lot more endpoints to the "usage" section</li>
<li>Adding links to the repositories for the binding projects.</li>
<li>Maybe adding Swagger links</li>
<li>Moving the guides for writing bots and integrations to the new /api-new site (right now most of the links take you to ReadTheDocs)</li>
<li>Moving it to take over the /api URL.</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The hope is that once we swap this in for the old /api, it'll be possible for several folks to collaboratively iterate on this.  I'd absolutely love it if a few folks played with the docs and tried to find anything that's worse in the new version than the old <code>/api</code>; hopefully we can fix those rapidly and then swap it in.</p>

<p>I guess one note is that probably for moving the guides, we should do it in 2 steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, move the content with minimal changes to make sure the framework works.</li>
<li>Second, consider splitting it up for the new context where we have tons of left-sidebar space.</li>
</ul>

<p>One thing I didn't like about it was that when I point my mouse at the right edge of the screen, it is not on the scrollbar. (Browser scrollbars can always be grabbed at the edge of the screen on Windows.)</p>
