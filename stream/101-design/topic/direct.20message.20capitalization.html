<p>Hey! How should we capitalize "direct message" in the compose box stream picker? The plan (cf. <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/25116">#25116</a>) had been to use "Direct Message". It's currently merged as "Direct message" as a last-minute linter failure fix. But we should decide what we actually want. :)</p>
<p>The idea with "Direct Message" is that it is more consistent with the "DM" abbreviation, which we are using once that option is selected. (And "Dm" would look quite odd.) "Direct message" follows our general sentence case pattern.</p>

<p>To avoid the consistency issue, I would prefer to simply see <code>Direct message</code> in the drop-down and when selected. That would make it as long as maybe <a class="stream" data-stream-id="19" href="/#narrow/stream/19-documentation">#documentation</a>, which doesn't seem like it would take up too much extra space.</p>

<p>I personally prefer "Direct Message".  Note that "direct" is a verb as well as an adjective, so my brain parses "Direct message" as "route message to foo".</p>

<p>DM as how we spell it with the picker closed feels a lot better in terms of making the private message compose experience not feel like it's worse because we have that menu to the left of the names of who you're talking to, especially in narrow windows.</p>

<p>It doesn't feel great if when the compose recipient part line wraps because of that widget, and spelling it DM prevents that outcome/feeling, since it's tiny as a result.</p>

<p>Another direction for the label inside the menu is "Switch to direct message".</p>

<p>English does not generally capitalize a phrase just because there exists an acronym for it, in the absence of some other reason to capitalize it like with proper nouns.</p>

<p>My mobile device is - for a laptop - a fairly narrow 1366 wide. If I switch that to half-width then it hides the side panels, so the compose box isn't much less spacious. Maybe if talking more like a 1/3 width instead I might understand, but frankly there are more issues there; I'd prefer dynamically changing to abbreviate to DM in that situation, or even simply showing the icon instead.</p>
