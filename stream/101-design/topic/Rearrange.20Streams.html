<p>Is it possible to order the streams as per User preference by dragging?<br>
It will be a great feature if someone wants to make stream order as per his convenience</p>

<p>I think most users find pinning to be sufficient</p>

<p>Another thing worth mentioning is that there are real downsides to having folks rearrange the sidebar, in that it limits your mind's ability to find the stream you're looking for, since the other won't be the alphabetical pattern, but instead something very different.</p>

<p>I have avoided the pinning feature so far because once pinned, the stream disappears from the alphabetical list below. Maybe a good compromise could be having duplicate entries for pinned streams?</p>

<p>That would have downsides too; we'd need to be thoughtful about how to display the stream being open.  (E.g. if you search for it, which sidebar copy opens to show the topics?)</p>
