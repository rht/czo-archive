<p>So, I've been thinking about whether we want to change the mentions narrow to be special, in the sense of not marking things as read if you just look at them there.</p>

<p>Not only that... they are used completely differently...</p>

<p>I think they are 100% match for the Facebook's notification menu and maybe we want to display them exactly like this - differently styled and totally non-readable. Possibly even shortened by default, ready to be clicked. As no one reads them in isolation. Even more so, if a user addresses several messages to a person, he usually mentions on the first message only.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think a part 2 of doing something like that would be a good idea as well.</p>

<p>We'll want to do the same with search, I think.</p>

<p>I reverted this because we've gotten feedback from various folks that they found it super confusing.</p>
<p>We may want to add it back after solving the UX problem that it's visually unclear if your current narrow can mark things as read or not.</p>

<p>So I think we should very possibly unrevert this change. Logically, the mentions narrow should work like other interleaved views that don't contain entire conversations -- in terms of not marking messages as read by default. </p>
<p>The reason we it configured like an interleaved view right now is that we didn't yet have UI explaining that it doesn't mark as read automatically or a "mark all as read" button, so changing the configuration in isolation wasn't a good experience (and in fact we reverted the first attempt to make such a change, as noted in the previous message).</p>

<p>Thoughts? I think concretely the change likely just requires changing <code>calc_can_mark_messages_read</code> to delete the 3-line <code>mentioned</code> block, plus some testing to make sure it feels nice, so it's very easy to try.</p>
