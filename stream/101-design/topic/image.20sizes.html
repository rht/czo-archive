<p>Well, as it seems Tim has indicated that display density might be considered for the next version, let me bring up a suggestion that might prove even more contentious. </p>
<p>In our realm, we really like images. Especially gifs. Many messages is nothing but a gif.</p>
<p>But Zulip scalling image the image down to preview size kinda takes the punch out of ones carefully selected gif.</p>
<p>So here's a radical suggestion: Let images be full width if they're large enough ("full" being limited to the maximum text with, which is dependent on the "Use full width on wide screens" option). It worked very nicely for Flowdock: <a href="http://blog.flowdock.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/the-next-flowdock.png">http://blog.flowdock.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/the-next-flowdock.png</a> (note: that's a single image with built in borders). OK, setting a max-height to something that's less than the users screen height is needed to account for hi-res portrait  images from phones, but that's a detail.</p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="http://blog.flowdock.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/the-next-flowdock.png"><img src="/external_content/c09f906f218d03c736c1e8268b7ad79a13ff5631/687474703a2f2f626c6f672e666c6f77646f636b2e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323031342f30372f7468652d6e6578742d666c6f77646f636b2e706e67"></a></div><p>As it is currently, images seems like a second class citizen to text. They're there, but you have to click them to see them, any text on them is mostly unreadable. At full width they become first class citizens, you'll be able to get a graphical message across without having to have people click on the image.</p>
<p>This could be tired to the most spacious display setting.</p>

<p>It certainly seems like a setting we could offer, if nothing else.  One important constraint with images is that unless we change the markup, it's very important for loading/scrolling user experience that the browser knows the precise size of an image element before it fetches the image over the network; otherwise you'll see the screen jumping around as images are loaded and the browser makes room for them in the DOM.</p>
<p>So there's two possible paths:</p>
<ul>
<li>We change to a new fixed height, say 300px with this setting, and all images are shown at that height instead.</li>
<li>We change the markup, by adding code that loads the image, does some processing, and then embeds size details (well, at least the height) in the HTML markup so that the browser has access to that information when rendering.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since we don't put content to the right of images, height, not width, is the issue here.</p>

<p>CommonMark allows inline images, and this seems useful, so the width will matter.</p>

<p>I think the jumping problem is one of many problems that would go away we used the normal page scrollbar (<a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/9911">#9911</a>). Browsers adjust the page scrolling position intelligently as things above the viewport change their size.</p>

<p>And it’s already an issue we have to some extent because of message editing.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Processing? Just reading the image size and adding width/height to the img element should do it, I recon. Then CSS can resize the element, and the browser knows the aspect of the image.</p>
<p>I seem to get a long way in the inspector by adding size and removing the <code>max-height</code> on <code>.rendered_markdown .message_inline_image</code>.</p>
<p>What's an "inline image"? The <code>![title](url)</code> syntax?</p>

<p>I mean inline in the CSS sense—images within the normal flow of text.</p>

<p>I asked the wrong question. I meant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CommonMark allows inline images</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s the question I thought I was answering. CommonMark <code>![title](url)</code> images are inline in the CSS sense.</p>

<p>And what we get when people drag in an image is actually a link... Which gets previewed even if the URL preview feature isn't enabled? (and same goes for URLs that's actually an image).</p>

<p>Yes, that’s the current situation.</p>
