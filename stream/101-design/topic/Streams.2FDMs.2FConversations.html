<p>Prompted by the discussion in <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="101" href="/#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/.22Private.22.20vs.20.22Direct.22">#design &gt; "Private" vs "Direct"</a>, I wanted to bring up an observed asymmetry between stream and private/direct messages terminology. While this is somewhat of a documentation issue, it's more regarding pinning down concepts/terms first, which may have impacts on the UI, before updating docs. Maybe to add to a future Zulip glossary?</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>"PMs" gets used a lot as an abbreviation in text/discussion; hardly ever a stream equivalent? (SMs?)</li>
<li>"PMs and stream messages" feels awkward to keep writing, as would "private- and stream-messages" (or similar for comparisons etc), at least in discussions</li>
<li>Other than in a code/API aspect, I second-guess what phrase to use to best convey 'stream messages' (topic? stream-topic?)</li>
<li>The UI points out they are PMs or "PRIVATE MESSAGES" (or "DIRECT MESSAGES"), not "PRIVATE" or "DIRECT" (cf "STREAMS")</li>
</ul>
<p>So, initial questions aimed at improving clarity:</p>
<ul>
<li>terms: should we use 'direct message' and 'stream message', or something clearer for the latter? (do we already define that?)</li>
<li>abbreviations: should we avoid abbreviating DMs? Or is there a good equivalent abbreviation for our choice for 'stream message'?</li>
<li>left panel: should we title the section 'DIRECT' in place of 'DIRECT MESSAGES'? Or extend 'STREAMS' to be 'STREAM MESSAGES'? (however, see below)</li>
</ul>
<p>Riffing from that last point and the UI a little further, do we have a written definition of 'conversation'?<br>
I assume, but am unsure if I've seen it defined, as "the set of private messages to the same group of users, or the set of messages to the same topic in a given stream"?<br>
That would suggest that in the left panel, at risk of being too verbose:</p>
<ul>
<li>'DIRECT MESSAGES' is more accurately 'DIRECT CONVERSATIONS', which would tie into 'more conversations' expanding that list</li>
<li>'STREAMS' may then be a reasonable title to keep, in tandem with expanding 'more topics' to 'more conversation topics'</li>
</ul>

<p>I think just "DIRECT" feels too brief/ambiguous, we're likely to stick with "DIRECT MESSAGES" for the heading.</p>

<p>I agree "DIRECT MESSAGE CONVERSATIONS" might be more accurate, but that's long in a way that I don't think is helpful.</p>

<p>Generally we have a project policy to avoid abbreviations; that likely should apply to "DMs" as well -- I'd want to only use the abbreviation when there isn't space to display it fully and it's difficult to adjust the design to avoid that constraint.</p>

<p>I think "direct message" and "stream message" would be terms we'd use conversationally and in Help Center documentation to explain the two types of messages, yes.</p>
