<p>I very much like the change to have avatars in autocomplete <a href="/user_uploads/2/84/uBCqxR0yrZjlHjFB3UA-k6Ye/image.png">image.png</a> <br>
But I struggle with that for a long time and wonder if you have a different perspective on my suggestion.<br>
The suggestion is to have PM be first in the list, since search is like a universal jump.<br>

<p>This seems somewhat arbitrary, either way. I think my point of view is that with the current search bar as it is, I would prefer the addition of a search area for PMs that would allow to prioritize users/conversations, while leaving the general search prioritizing sent-by. That is, adding a search area for PMs like we do with streams/topics/users.</p>
<p>Maybe it would break general design principles here, but if every user has 2 (or more) cases, it almost feels like a multi-column drop-down could be an interesting solution, perhaps even with other non-user matches in separate columns - reverting to nested columns in narrow windows. I think a similar design is used in some modern web designs, though typically with a static drop-down, not for search.</p>

<p>As in, putting it before "Sent by"? I tend to agree. I think we originally had it that way, and made the change to "Sent by" first a few years ago under the reasoning that you can just go to the right sidebar to find the user, but in practice I often find it's not what I want.</p>

<p>I think a better design would be to somehow have the "Sent by" vs "private messages with" part be a kind of independent variable from the user matching, so you'd get 10 users to match.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what the right representation would be, but one could imagine having a button in the row for each user that's a "Sent by" button you can click if you want that.</p>

<p>But that's likely to be a fairly involved change to figure out; it's probably an immediate improvement to just swap the order to prefer your conversation with someone over sender matching.</p>

<p>Hmm, I think I agree with Neil's and Tim's comments above about figuring out some better way to represent the two concepts alongside each other being the ideal solution.</p>

<p>I'm not so sure that putting PMs over "sent by" will be an improvement. We will soon make PMs easier to find in the left sidebar, in addition to them being reachable from the right sidebar. You can get to "View messages sent" from a user's profile, but that's more obscure.</p>

<p>I think the challenge is different users have different workflows and thus different expectations for what to do with the search box -- if you want to use search as just a general "fast navigation to a conversation" widget, then you want pm-with to take priority. If you're doing a search for a particular message, "sender" is more often what you're looking for.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, we figure out how to make the UI fast for both use cases; resorting between "Sender" and "private messages with" basically swaps which of those workflows we're making nice.</p>

<p>If we would have data on frequency of usage or at least how many users prefer that option we could be sure...</p>

<p>Using stats on usage will be biased towards the current UI, I would have thought.</p>
<p>As it is I can type 'Nei' here and it only shows one option (sent-by) with lots of people; 'Neil' starts to show pm as an option, and 'Neil P' group-pm. While not every organization will have duplicate names, those lower options need surfacing, but likely only with big changes to the search widget? Those are important, but if there's an alternative dedicated interface in the mean-time (like PMs-specific search) then it would be less important in the short-term.</p>

<p>I think probably it'd still be useful to have data for the relative frequency of "narrowed to pm-with via the search bar" vs. "narrowed to sender via the search bar". If we found sender is much less common, that'd be clear evidence; I agree it'd be inconclusive without testing the other default ordering if we found "sender" is more commonly what folks visit.</p>

<p>I'm out of time for today but we can probably spec out a logging system that could answer this question.</p>
