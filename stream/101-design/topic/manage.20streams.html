<p>I'm going to do a <a href="http://chat.zulip.org">chat.zulip.org</a> deployment soon so that folks can play with it, but today I merged a bunch of changes designed to clean up both the visuals and CSS of "Manage streams" to match how our settings look, rather than having a parallel set of visuals with a parallel CSS implementation that used a different approach to indentation, aligning checkboxes with their labels, etc.  See <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/20333">#20333</a> for a reference, though note the last screenshots there are a bit out of date (and there's a couple issues noted in the last comment on the PR).</p>
