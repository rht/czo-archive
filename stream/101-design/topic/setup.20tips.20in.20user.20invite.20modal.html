<p>In <a href="https://zulip.com/help/getting-your-organization-started-with-zulip">https://zulip.com/help/getting-your-organization-started-with-zulip</a>, we document some steps organizations should take prior to inviting users. It would probably be helpful to suggest these directly in the <code>INVITE USERS TO ZULIP</code> modal.</p>
<p><a href="/user_uploads/2/b5/z1guVj_qIb9M1IdfH87PypST/Screen-Shot-2023-01-11-at-8.15.19-PM.png">Screen-Shot-2023-01-11-at-8.15.19-PM.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/b5/z1guVj_qIb9M1IdfH87PypST/Screen-Shot-2023-01-11-at-8.15.19-PM.png" title="Screen-Shot-2023-01-11-at-8.15.19-PM.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/b5/z1guVj_qIb9M1IdfH87PypST/Screen-Shot-2023-01-11-at-8.15.19-PM.png"></a></div><p>The main steps in the documentation are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create your organization profile (see also <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="101" href="/#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/organization.20profile.20banner">#design &gt; organization profile banner</a> )</li>
<li>Customize organization settings -- looking over the settings, I think organization permissions would be the most pressing thing to highlight.</li>
<li>Create streams</li>
<li>Customize settings for new users<br>
  a. Add custom profile fields, such as pronouns or job title.<br>
  b. Configure default new user settings.<br>
  c. Set default streams for new users.<br>
  d. Set organization language for automated messages and invitation emails, if it should be something other than American English.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some thoughts on how we could incorporate these into the modal, with links to the appropriate settings panels throughout. Each of these would only be shown if the user has the permissions needed to take the relevant action.</p>
<h2>At the top of the modal</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[for 1] If the org description and/or org profile picture has not been set:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may want to configure your organization's login page prior to inviting users.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>[for 4a, 4b]  Could show this only if the info above is not shown, to avoid dumping too many action items on the user at once. Could also be conditioned on (a) whether default new user settings have been changed, and (b) whether any custom profile fields have been added.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may want to configure default new user settings and custom profile fields prior to inviting users.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Just above the "Streams they should join" section</h2>
<ul>
<li>[for 3] If no streams have been created:<blockquote>
<p>You may want to create streams prior to inviting users.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<p>That all makes sense to me.</p>
<p>For permissions, I think the key is for the defaults to be on the side of privacy.</p>
<p>It's fine if there are surprises in the form of users having to bug the admin to give them access to things — that's really no loss if the alternative was for us to bug the admin pre-emptively to go wade through a bunch of docs or a bunch of settings UI.

<p>(Fun example of the latter, bad case: when I was one of the people running a mailing-list service for college student groups, the mailing lists defaulted to having web-public archives, and some people creating lists didn't realize that.</p>
<p>This included a social club talking about which would-be members to admit, and which to reject.</p>

<p>I think the UI/technical architecture you describe, which roughly matches the <code>navbar_alerts.js</code> system (for top-of-webapp banners), where we show at most one banner, with each banner having conditions under which it might appear and the checks done in a given order that effectively defines their priorities, makes sense.</p>

<p>And I think the org description/profile suggestion is probably the one that is most clearly a fit for moving here. </p>
<p>There is a trade-off -- if you're making an organization open to the public, you may never use the "invite more users" UI -- but probably you'll end up looking at that panel at some point before just posting your URL for users to join? And if not, we can potentially have a copy of this sort of banners thing also displayed in the settings UI for making an organization open for the public to join.</p>
<p>(An alternative thought is that it should just be a requirement to set an organization profile before making an organization open? But that may be more complexity than it's worth, idunno)</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="19257">@Alya Abbott</span> I finally resumed the work on this, I have for now successfully figured out how to show "Org profile configuration" tips but I am not so sure about how I should go about "User configs" tips because I will need to compare bunch of settings for it!

<p>Also, it's weird that zulipbot has not removed <code>has conflicts</code> tag from the PR when I am sure that my PR is up-to-date with main:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>b10d6a7aa4 (HEAD -&gt; invite-modal, origin/invite-modal) invite: Add setup tips to user invite modal.
126f3b5f47 (upstream/main, main) node_cache: Work around pnpm install issue in Docker for Mac.
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here are the latest two commits on PR branch.</p>

<p>This looks like a zulipbot bug of some sort to me -- it rebases cleanly onto current <code>main</code>.</p>

<p>zulipbot should be just a mirror of GitHub's own display for whether it displays conflicts. (GitHub's display is arguably inaccurate; it doesn't simulate rebasing across file renames as well as Git itself does -- though generally you want a human to look anyway, so it's not necessarily a bad thing).</p>
