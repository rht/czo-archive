<p>My friend Teresa just started using Zulip today. She self-registered, and when she saw "You look familiar" she assumed that meant she already had an account -- and then when she used "Forgot password" and it did not explicitly say anything about whether she had a pre-existing account or not, she didn't notice that. I had to help her out and say "try creating a new account" - otherwise she would have waited a long time.</p>
<p>But overall she likes the UI.</p>

<p>Yeah I just checked it with a random email and it didn't say anything about having not having pre-existing account. So the "Forgot password" page must throw an error if the email submitted doesn't have an account already!</p>

<p>It doesn't give you an error because (I assume this is the reason) we want to protect people's privacy. If I put in the address of someone I'm stalking, I shouldn't be able to find out whether or not they have an account.</p>

<p>I agree on that. But it may also leave people in a clueless state right?</p>

<p>Yeah, so I think it might be a good idea to be more explicit and less humorous about what we're doing.</p>

<p>But I figured I'd hear from one or two other people in this stream before filing a bug....</p>

<p>Thanks for the report Teresa and Sumana! I agree we should change it; opening an issue sounds good to me.</p>

<p>Any GSoC applicants around - this would be a reasonable bug to consider fixing.</p>
