<p>We currently show a special notice at the bottom of the three-dot menu for messages that were sent when you were not subscribed to the stream:</p>
<p><a href="/user_uploads/2/8a/BO-Snd_OdY6vsXGh4zXnPS2Y/Screen-Shot-2022-10-03-at-12.56.26-PM.png">Screen-Shot-2022-10-03-at-12.56.26-PM.png</a> </p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/8a/BO-Snd_OdY6vsXGh4zXnPS2Y/Screen-Shot-2022-10-03-at-12.56.26-PM.png" title="Screen-Shot-2022-10-03-at-12.56.26-PM.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/8a/BO-Snd_OdY6vsXGh4zXnPS2Y/Screen-Shot-2022-10-03-at-12.56.26-PM.png"></a></div><p>What are the reasons to do so? I'm not sure why this information would be important when viewing that menu, and I wonder whether we should drop it.</p>

<p>Heheh, amazing. I guess at the time nobody suggested a reason. ;)</p>

<p>This feature was added in <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/ae4d248da300025493fb09c485d29308c6bade62">ae4d248da300025493fb09c485d29308c6bade62</a>, back in 2013. Commit messages were less good about explaining the motivation for changes back then <span aria-label="confused" class="emoji emoji-1f615" role="img" title="confused">:confused:</span>. </p>
<p>Currently we surface whether a message was sent at such a time in a second way, via the "You (un)subscribed to this stream" type divider lines; that feature was added in <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/82da2bec107641998806b1855998c7e17f3546e4">82da2bec107641998806b1855998c7e17f3546e4</a>, aka about 6 days later also in 2013.</p>

<p>I think the motivation for this is likely somewhat subtle; but one thing it does is provides an explanation for "Why did I not find this message when searching my personal message history? It has the word X right there!", which is our default search behavior and the only thing we supported for search at the time.</p>

<p>(This is certainly not an elegant solution to that problem statement).</p>

<p>Yeah, that's probably neither a common question (especially now that you can search all public messages), nor a natural place to look for an answer to it.</p>
