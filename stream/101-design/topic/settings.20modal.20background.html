<p>Should we make our settings and stream settings background white? I started thinking about it in the context of the link color discussion on <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/12321" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/12321">#12321</a>.</p>
<p>Every other product I can think of has a white settings page (even gmail, which used to have a lightly colored one). One benefit of us matching that pattern are that button colors, link colors, etc don't have to be redesigned just for the settings page. Also I think white will look more modern.</p>

<p>I don't have strong feelings one way or the other.  It's certainly something reasonable to experiment with, and I could imagine the result looking cleaner (I do feel like the off-white looks enterprisey in a not great way).</p>
