<p>Thinknig of ways to make the UX simpler for new users. Would it make sense to remove "Manage organization" from the gear menu for non-admins? They can still get to it from the settings modal.</p>

<p>One nitpick: it actually says "Organization settings" for non-admins.  I'm +0.2 on your suggestion.  I like that your suggestion would reduce cognitive clutter for newbies, but occasionally it's nice to tell users that they can go to the gear menu to see how their org is set up.</p>

<p>If you want to do that, I'd consider just putting it under the <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> tag and near "Help center".  Since these are all basically info:</p>
<ul>
<li>Org settings</li>
<li>Help center</li>
<li>Keyboard shortcuts</li>

<li>Search operators</li>

<p>I'd be happy to rename "Manage organization" to "Organization settings" for admins, so that we can keep our help consistent.  I think this thread is a case in point where presenting different names to admins makes them unaware of what normal users actually see.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that "organization settings" is available for users to manage user groups, custom emoji, see other users in the organization, etc., so it's not actually something we want to be hiding for normal users.</p>

<p>Changing it to consistently say "Organization settings" is reasonable.  I think the original reason for keeping the difference was that was the main way to tell you're an administrator before, but now we just display your role in user popovers, "my account", etc.</p>

<p>There's possibly also some argument for just having a single "Settings" for both admins and normal users, which is how most products handle this. And then on the settings page itself the user can click "You" or "Organization" to get to your settings or the organization settings. </p>
<p>Currently we have 4 different things you can click on to get to your settings (desktop gear in lower left, manage streams, settings, and organization settings).</p>

<p>If you're an administrator, you likely access it a lot more than you do settings.  And browsing organization settings is a nontrivial part of the evaluation experience.</p>

<p>I also think on org admin can bear the burden of a non optional UX experience. The idea here should be to make users lives easier first. I feel like admin can handle an extra click.</p>
<p>That being said, it feels like a bit of organisation smell that a non admin needs “Organization Settings”. I’m not sure what the right solution here is but they shouldn’t need to see that tab at all.</p>

<p>I agree browsing org settings is a part of the evaluation experience, but it's also something that I would expect to be under "settings" from other products. E.g. just checked both Front and GitHub; there's one menu item called "Settings", which takes you to a page where you can easily click on whether you're doing personal settings or organization settings.</p>

<p>After giving it a bit of thought, in my opinion the organisation settings should be hidden from users. A new view calling “manage” should be created that consists of streams, groups, and emoji so for a normal user the menu options would have settings and manage options. I’m not too happy with the word manage but structurally to me it makes more sense.</p>
<p>I apologise if my input on this thread has been premature or not thought out.</p>

<p>As for letting users see who’s on the realm I believe this is what the buddy list should achieve. I think all the menu items under the help subsection (shortcuts, formatting, operators), as well as information like available bots and other information users currently discover in the organization settings section should be available under a section called help and documentation.</p>
