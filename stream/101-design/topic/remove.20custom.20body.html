<p>Currently we allow users to add a custom body to invitation emails. I think this might have made sense in the past, but doesn't make sense today. </p>
<ul>
<li>Most products' invitation emails are giant CTA plus decorative text, and I think that's the right model for zulip as well. Google groups is the one holdout that I know, and I've never used their custom body feature for actual content.</li>
<li>It's one more barrier in the onboarding flow; i.e. one more thing to think about between signing up for zulip and inviting your boss to check it out. </li>
<li>It's a lot of work to make it a good experience. Email is already hard, and with custom body we have to design an email that works regardless of what content is in the custom body. E.g. currently we'd like our invite email to be a giant CTA with decorative text. But that is at odds with having custom body text that is meant to be read.</li>
<li>There's work remaining to make it a good experience in the invite modal, and to include the custom body in resent invitations.</li>
<li>There are lots of non-email ways to invite people nowadays, where custom body won't apply anyway. E.g. posting a multiuse invite link to a facebook group, or posting just the bare URL for an open realm.</li>
<li>If you need to append a long message to an email invitation, I think the right solution is a "copy invite link", and then you can take that invite link and embed it in a fully custom email, that you can write in your email client.</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess that was a bit longer than intended, but thoughts?</p>

<p>Hmm, interesting thought.</p>

<p>I agree, even with products that have a way to send something with text inside, I usually prefer to send my own explanation out-of-band, if I have any</p>

<p>Because the channels I already have are much more likely to be read than I expect the little blob inside the product's email to be -- really, I'm sending the explanation in order to get the person to even open the mail at all</p>

<p>The only time I really want to fill in an explanation like that <em>inside</em> the product, is when I'm reaching out through the product to someone I don't have an outside connection to -- like an Airbnb host or something, or like many people use LinkedIn for</p>

<p>Yeah, and agreed that "copy invite link" is a valuable feature and that it should be able to take the place of custom body text. At least the way I use things, it would.</p>

<p>opened <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/7672" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/7672">#7672</a> for remove custom body.</p>
<p>Now that I think about it more carefully, "copy invite link" is a sort of complicated feature given our current backend assumptions. The simplest would be to support exactly two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A list of emails that you can invite</li>
<li>A multiuse invite link that you can copy. </li>
</ul>
<p>I think that's probably fine for now, though.</p>
