<p>At present, if you are composing a PM with some valid recipients and also an invalid recipient, clicking "Send" just sends it to the valid recipients, without notifying you that anything is wrong.</p>
<p>That doesn't seem like the right behavior... Thoughts on what we should do in this situation?</p>
<p>I'm thinking putting up a banner and blocking you from sending might be reasonable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your message was not sent because a recipient you entered ("flskajfv") does not exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We could also potentially offer to send to the valid users (the current behavior, but with explicit approval), but that might be more confusing than useful.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think making you remove invalid recipients is the correct/expected behavior.</p>

<p>I would likely go with simpler text: "Invalid recipient: {invalid_recipient}" ... or maybe something like displaying it in red and having it flash/flicker. Would be worth looking at how other compose elements (gmail, say) do this.</p>

<p>Gmail gives you a pop-up after you click "Send", which I wouldn't say is ideal. There's also a red underline under the name in the "To" field.</p>

<p>Slack just doesn't let you leave the addressee area in an invalid state. Similarly for FB messenger.</p>

<p>I kinda hate things that don't let you click on something else, but I suppose we could, say, just remove any extra/invalid items when focus leaves the input.</p>

<p>That's annoying in its own way, right? If you had a letter off and didn't notice, and now you have to retype the whole thing?</p>

<p>I like the banner idea. I'm feeling that we can have something similar to "Sent! Your message is outside your current narrow. <a href="http://">Narrow to private messages with xxxx</a>"? With something to click on to quickly remove all the invalid recipients.</p>

<p>This sounds pretty good to me, actually — as long as that red underline succeeds at clearly indicating that something is wrong, anyway. (Perhaps something other than a red underline would be better at that.)</p>
<p>With that design:</p>
<ul>
<li>as soon as you leave the addressee area with things in an invalid state, you get a clear indication that it's invalid;</li>
<li>but there's no rush or pressure — you can go deal with something else first and come back;</li>
<li>and if you had like one letter off, you can fix that one letter and not retype the whole thing.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think that'd be a more important consideration if the model was one where you might introduce a new user to the tool by typing it in, like with an email client. But in Zulip, you're doing autocomplete of users from a known set of possible users, and I think a partial autocompletion of a user identity is much lower value.</p>

<p>In particular, the sequence would be "fixing one letter" and then selecting the actual user pill from the typeahead who matched your search.</p>

<p>I think the pop-up option is potentially a fine user experience, but I'm not sure it's the most suitable design given the constraints here. </p>
<p>My main thought is that I think this is pretty low importance; I don't believe having incomplete text in that box has been a likely situation to end up in ever since we migrated to the pills model for the private message recipients.</p>
