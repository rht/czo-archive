<p>Do private streams never get demoted? Is that intentional? I have streams in my sidebar that haven't had messages for a year.</p>

<p>Hm, on another Zulip I definitely have private streams in the inactive section of the sidebar.</p>

<p>Pinned streams never get demoted; <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="9808">@Yash RE</span> is it possible you pinned those streams?</p>

<p>They were definitely not pinned because they were not in the pinned section. However, now I no longer have those streams there. I did toggle the demotion setting a couple of times, and it's possible that's what fixed things.</p>

<p>I think stream demotion is based on how often you open the stream, not how often there are message, right? Since I've definitely had the experience of opening a stream that has been demoted and having that stick it in the non-demoted section for a while.</p>

<p>Yeah, I've experienced that too, but I don't think that's what's meant to happen... is it?</p>

<p>The demotion definitions are indeed based on whether you have any messages in your local cache from the stream; arguably that's correct since you might want to see streams you've visited during today's session even if they have old content.</p>

<p>But I could also imagine making that decision based on a more limited data source.</p>
