<p>Drafts aren't currently super visible. IMO we should do something like this:</p>
<p><a href="/user_uploads/2/7e/2ewUndh2yixjTOul0ZCKIu_-/Screen-Shot-2021-07-03-at-4.38.30-PM.png">.</a> </p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/7e/2ewUndh2yixjTOul0ZCKIu_-/Screen-Shot-2021-07-03-at-4.38.30-PM.png" title="."><img src="/user_uploads/2/7e/2ewUndh2yixjTOul0ZCKIu_-/Screen-Shot-2021-07-03-at-4.38.30-PM.png"></a></div><p>This has a few advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Puts drafts in a (IMO) more intuitive place (or at the very least, in the same place most other similar apps put it)</li>
<li>Reduces the number of items in the bottom bar (see <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="101" href="/#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/bottom.20row.20design">#design &gt; bottom row design</a> for some history here)</li>
<li>Makes it more visible when you have drafts (since it looks sort of like an unread count, which is in a place people actually look)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the long-term, we should do a similar thing to Recent Topics, where we convert <a href="#drafts">#drafts</a> from a modal to a screen that appears in the center column, but much like the Recent Topics transition, I don't think we need to block moving drafts to the sidebar on this.</p>
<p>I was talking with <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="7">Tim Abbott</span> about this yesterday, and could put up a PR for this if it's something we're interested in doing.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>I am not obsessed with left sidebar real estate, since my streams don’t fit completely under any regime.  But I do think we should try to minimize the footprint of the top left corner.  Do we want an icon bar instead of six rows?  (Private messages would still be its own row.)</p>

<p>For reducing the top-left-corner height, can we just remove one of the "All messages" and "Recent topics" buttons, particularly the one which isn't the default view setting for the user?</p>

<p>Yeah, it seems worth thinking about vertical space here. I don't think a row of icons would be good, since it's much harder to figure out what an icon does than a thing that has text next to it. My inclination is definitely that making drafts more visible is worth one stream's worth of space on the sidebar, but I don't think we should add things to that list willy-nilly.</p>

<p>It'd be great if Drafts was a tab in the composer window, regardless if composer ends up being in a modal or not (or user can choose that setting). I hear there are some plans for the latter according to <a href="#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/Composer.20as.20dialog.20box.3F">this topic</a>, but I'm not sure where the standing is of an overhaul of the composer itself...</p>

<p>It's a very sensible place to put it... A couple of projects that will interact with this idea:</p>
<ol>
<li>Moving PMs to just above streams and leaving them expanded. (<span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="7">Tim Abbott</span> needs to write up an issue for this.) It will make the left sidebar real estate more precious, though it could still be worth putting drafts there.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/18555">#18555</a> (restore drafts by default) will somewhat reduce the need to open up one's drafts, though it's not going to eliminate it.</li>

<p>The main downside of doing such a migration would be that it'd be harder to open drafts without navigating somewhere.  Not sure it matters, given that selecting a draft will navigate you to the context of that draft anyway.</p>

<p>I see the advantage to having it in the center pane, although I think an overlay is quite possibly the better choice. I think there's probably a significant percentage of the time that people click on drafts, then decide (for whatever reason, maybe there isn't a draft they want, etc) not to open a draft that I think it's probably worth keeping it as an overlay.</p>
<p>People can press the back button to get back where they were, but I don't think most people realize that or think to do it.</p>

<p>Now that we've fixed the flashing notification bug with having drafts in the left sidebar, I think there's a few open questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we want a privacy setting for whether drafts are synced with the server?  If so, we can build that now.  </li>
<li>If so, do we want to display the value of that setting in the "Drafts" panel?</li>
<li>If so, should we consider merging this feature and just having the notice on the "Drafts" panel say "Drafts are local to this client" with whatever style/design we want to use there?  And then when we add server sync, presumably it'd become a message that's either "You have configured drafts to never be synced with other clients | Drafts are synchronized with other Zulip clients." or something?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a screenshot of the drafts panel for reference:</p>

<p>It's not necessarily that weird, I think, to copy and paste a big block of text from somewhere else, and remove private bits. That's a case where you might be happy to share the finished message with the server, but not the drafts.</p>

<p>Mm, fair enough, but that still seems like a rare enough use case that I wouldn't want to prioritize building a setting at this point. If folks feel nervous about Zulip having that data, they can edit the block of text in another app before pasting it in.</p>

<p>Another option would be "Drafts are not synced to your other devices and browsers." ; "across" feels a bit complex and might not internationalize as well.</p>

<p>I think the problem with that one is that is that it doesn't address the most salient direction for the user who is having an, "oh no, where did all my drafts go?" experience.</p>
<p>We could do ""Drafts are not synced between your devices and browsers."</p>

<p>"Between" there sounds like it's about syncing between your devices on the one hand, and your browsers on the other.</p>

<p>Yeah, "across" has the same issue to some extent; I like the "to other" just because it's clear we're not carefully saying that it only syncs to one other type of client, or something.</p>

<p>Merging this with "Drafts are not synced to other devices and browsers."</p>

<p>The merged version is now running here!  It'll be in Zulip Cloud next week probably; holler if you notice anything wrong!</p>
