<p>So I just merged and am deploying here a series of refactors to the message content CSS to make it a lot more sane and readable, and also to improve the way we handle formatting of paragraphs adjacent to non-paragraph things like blockquotes.  I suspect there will be some smaller tweaks we'll do on top of this over the coming days to adjust 1-3px in a few places to make things look nicer, but I just wanted to flag this change as a potential source for bugs that everyone should be on the look for starting in about 5 minutes when the deploy finishes. <span aria-label="slight smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="slight smile">:slight_smile:</span></p>
<p>I'd like to thank <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="11190">@Vinit Singh</span> for helping pushing this forward -- his work helped me figure out what we should do to make this more rational.  The branch is the commits ending with <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/d14a1fd1b12dc7dcbb6397ef76702267612efedc" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/d14a1fd1b12dc7dcbb6397ef76702267612efedc">d14a1fd1b12dc7dcbb6397ef76702267612efedc</a>.</p>
