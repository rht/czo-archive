<p>Hi Zulip community,</p>
<p>I'm Prashant Manda, currently an Interaction Design Student at NID Bengaluru, India.</p>
<p>I'm really enthusiastic about working with Zulip for Google Summer of Code 2019.<br>
Among the listed project ideas, <strong>Zulip settings and administration pages</strong> seems the most appealing to me.</p>
<p>I have prior experience in working across frontend frameworks and UI Prototyping Tools .<br>
Can someone help me to get started, please?</p>
<p>Regards<br>
Prashant Manda</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="9876">@Sameer Choubey</span> thanks,</p>
<p>I am already referring to the contribution page. </p>
<p>There are changes that I wish to propose and suggestions to put forward regarding a project (say <strong>X</strong> ). <br>
This is my first time in GSOC and I don't know how to go about communicating my ideas to the community/experts. </p>
<p>I need insights on the same. The contribution page tells me that we have an expert on the projects I mentioned <br>
above and as I explore the Zulip, there are newcomers like me and then there are people who've been <br>
using Zulip for over 2-3 years.</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

<p>Welcome <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="11675">@Prashant Manda</span> <img alt=":zulip:" class="emoji" src="/static/generated/emoji/images/emoji/unicode/zulip.png" title="zulip">  It is welcomed to have your interest in UI Design and frontend.  You should start by referring to the contributing guide and then start by making small fixes to the application and make PRs. Fixes could of already created easy issues in Github or could be something you feel is out of place and can be improved. I'd suggest you to discuss whatever change you are doing before creating a PR for it.</p>
