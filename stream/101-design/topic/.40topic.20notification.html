<p>This is a feature I have been wanting. I know I thought about entering an issue on github, ATM I can't remember if I did, so I'll just throw it out here.<br>
I would like to have @topic notify everyone who have written something in that topic.</p>

<p>We  have streams with say 30 people. Say Tim posts some question. Roger replies, and Anne says someting. I come in with a remark. The conversation carries on, a couple more people are active. Then I want to @-notify all those who have participated so far. I do not want to disturb all 30 in the stream. Then I would say @topic.</p>

<p>This is certainly a feature we intend to build.  It might actually be a good preparation for the more complex "follow topic" feature, since it involves the same code path but doesn't require the same complexity of settings and the like.</p>

<p>I don't think it'd be a ton of work, but I also don't have time to dig into the details of how it'd work right now.  Maybe later this week I can do an issue writeup.</p>
