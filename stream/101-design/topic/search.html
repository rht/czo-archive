<p>(the stream of this topic could also be "HCI" (as how Alan Kay would put it), or some groups of people would prefer to say, "UX")</p>
<p>scenario: I was trying to search for a particular topic within the mountains of streams consisting of the topics. I wasn't able to do so via the stream search icon. Then I tried the global search box,  but was misled in assuming that I could search only in one stream at a time (the stream name with color next to |:home:&gt; appears as if the search box is "hardened" only to search in that particular stream. I clicked at the :home: again, to finally discover that I am able to search by topic from there.</p>
<p>1) I think <code>|:home:&gt; design| :search: stream:design</code>could be clarified with <code>|:home:&gt; :search: stream:design</code>.<br>
2) The <code>Search people</code> box in the Users sidebar could be replaced with a search button where it reveals a search box -- this is to be consistent with the streams sidebar.<br>
3) Option to search by topic, in the expanded stream search box (I'm not sure this is necessary if 1) is implemented)</p>

<p>To your first point, I think the juxtaposition of the narrowing indication with the search bar is a bit redundant/awkward.   We could put search bar in a better position to show its logical function within the app, but it's a bit tricky to do so without wasting valuable screen real estate.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-email="showell@zulipchat.com" data-user-id="58">@Steve Howell</span> I assume the current design is this way because it is what is intuitive to the accumulative usage of the search bar, i.e. people likely search within a stream much more often than they do globally/cross-streams; so it is just one datapoint of my accumulative use case: I interpreted the <code>|:home:&gt; stream &gt; topic</code>(I don't know what this is named in the code) as to narrow the search rather than as an address / URI to point where I am located at in the realm. I have used the highlight in the sidebar and the URI of each message boxes to know which topic I am located at (in a way that this is a redundant information to 'that'). My heatmap is that I navigate to find a topic by clicking through the sidebars more often than using the global search bar (but default to stream search at almost every case).</p>

<p>I think the positioning of the search bar is mostly where it is so that it's prominent and easy to find.  I rarely use search myself.  I'm not sure how much I subconsciously use the indicators to the left of search to orient myself.</p>

<p>Yea, I've never really noticed the indicators to the left of the search or when I'm in a narrow.</p>

<p>Ways to quantify the accumulative use cases of streams:<br>
1) For each user's message log, calculate the number of context-switching happening within a stream divided by the total messages sent, and the number of context-switching between streams divided by the total messages sent, then check the histograms.<br>
2) The ratio between narrowed searches and global searches.</p>

<p>I think the page would look cleaner if we simply eliminated them, but it's hard to know how much value they have for other users (or even myself, if I'm using it as a subsconcious cue).</p>
