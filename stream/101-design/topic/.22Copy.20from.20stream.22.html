<p>I noticed a bug in the order of streams shown in the "Copy from stream" list in the stream creation menu (reported in <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="9" href="/#narrow/stream/9-issues/topic/.22Copy.20from.20stream.22.20order">#issues &gt; "Copy from stream" order</a> ), and it got me thinking about whether we should make a change there.</p>
<p>I believe the current intended behavior is to show all the subscribed streams (alphabetically), followed by all the unsubscribed streams (alphabetically). But there is no explicit indication to the user that this is what we're doing, and I think it can be very confusing to see a kind-of-but-not-actually alphabetical list. So I think we should figure out a way to make the behavior explicitly indicated.</p>
<p>A couple of options come to mind:<br>
1) Have two sections you can open up: "Copy from subscribed streams", and "Copy from all streams". Each one would just list the relevant streams in alphabetical order.<br>
2) Keep the one section you can open but add labels for the two groups of streams underneath. I'm not sure how to make that work well visually.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>At present we have two overlapping mechanisms for copying membership: One when editing an existing stream, and one during stream creation.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, we should pick whichever we think is closer to being what we want long term (probably the stream edit one with pills), and then unify them in a way that lets us just have a single component that we're going to make nice.</p>

<p>I think I agree that the pills approach is more promising.</p>
<p>We should think about the UI for adding individuals as well, which has the same distinction: checkboxes for new streams vs. pills for existing streams.</p>

<p>The checkboxes are nice when you just have a few people, but are in a large organization you pretty much have to rely on the filtering component above.</p>

<p>Adding the pills could live-update the stream membership table we have for existing streams, with some kind of clear indication that the users haven't actually been added yet. We could have some text in the Actions column to that effect, e.g. "Click Add to subscribe".</p>

<p>Ok, how about this proposal for the "People to add" section of the "Create stream" UI?</p>
<p>Copy  the "Add subscribers" UI (screenshot below) with the following changes:</p>
<p>1) Have the user table get live-updated as you add/remove pills.<br>
2) Rename the buttons "Unsubscribe" -&gt; "Remove".<br>
3) (maybe) Make the input box 2 lines tall to be more encouraging of adding a bunch of users.</p>

5) Make that heading have the same font as the headings above.</p>
