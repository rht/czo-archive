<p>As <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="7">Tim Abbott</span> mentions <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/21611#discussion_r856846275">here</a>, we are planning to allow a user to add/remove a subgroup from a user group if the user can see that the subgroup exists, even if user is not a member of that subgroup.</p>
<p>To make it clear, the user needs to have permission to add members to the user group to which subgroups are being added/removed.</p>
<p>Any feedback or thoughts on this?</p>

<p>To the extent that adding people to a group is mostly just giving them permissions, that sounds right.</p>
<p>The one down side of being added to a group that I can think of is that maybe someone would want to get notifications for the inner group but not the outer group. But if it becomes a problem, I think we can fine-tune this by giving users finer-grained control over notifications.</p>

<p>Yeah, that sounds right to me. I suppose the other category that could be problematic is if having another group be a subgroup of a group you manage gives you special permissions to access that group (E.g. if you don't have permission to see its membership, and end up with permission to see it recursive membership).</p>

<p>I expect that sort of thing would be managed when adding that sort of "Access to membership" future restriction in the first place.</p>
