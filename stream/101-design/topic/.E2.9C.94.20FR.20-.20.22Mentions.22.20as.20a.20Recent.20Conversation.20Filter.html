<p>Hey there! It would be really useful for us to be able to filter conversations as ones where we were mentioned in, but not necessarily ones we've directly participated in (or a combination filter between the two would also work well). As there currently is no differentiation between a direct Mention and a group-level Mention, this can lead to needing to toggle between the two sidebar items frequently in organizations where groups are used heavily like ours. </p>
<p>If there's already a topic on this, feel free to move the message, I couldn't find any in my brief search.</p>

<p>Disregard, I just noticed that I had a separate topic a while back that was similar in nature that I'd forgotten about. Whoops!</p>
