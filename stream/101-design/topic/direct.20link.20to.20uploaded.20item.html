<p>If I upload an item but didn't end up sending, it shows up in uploaded files but there is no direct way to access the item. The only way to access uploaded items is by opening the message in which they are attached and then downloading them. Does it make sense to add link to uploaded files directly in settings/uploaded files?</p>

<p>I am working on showing user quota of uploaded files so can add this too as part of the PR if it makes sense.</p>

<p>Hmm, yeah, that is awkward. Adding a link sounds reasonable to me.</p>
