<p>One question to fork off from the <a href="#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/New.20permissions.20model/near/1268620">new permissions model discussion</a> is how we want the "Members" and "Full Members" user groups to work.  For context, the current model is we have a hierarchy of system groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Moderators" contains "Administrators" as a group plus individual users whose role is Moderator.</li>
<li>"Administrators" contains "Owners" as a group plus individual users whose role is Administrator.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is nice for the default roles, but the "Full Member" permission is different, because that's determined by <a href="https://zulip.com/help/restrict-permissions-of-new-members">when the member joined</a> and thus changes dynamically with time.  </p>
<p>So if one wants to arrange so that a user is in exactly one of these system groups, one will end up with the user being removed from direct membership in the Members group and added to the Full Members group (or the opposite) as the account ages and the cutoff setting is changed.</p>
<p>The alternative model is that users should be in exactly one of the Owners/Administrators/Moderators/Members/Guests groups, and additionally users in the Members group may also be direct members of the Full Members group.  I think that latter model feels more natural/simpler as a way to think about things.  </p>
<p>I think it's a design question because UI that lists all the groups a user is a member of will either show both "Full Members" and "Members" or just one of them, depending on what we decide here.</p>

<p>We could have the relationship between "Full Members" and "Members" be the same as "Owners" to "Admins" and "Admins" to "Moderators", right? "Members" would contain "Full Members" as a group, plus individuals. I'm not sure if that's what you're suggesting above.</p>

<p>Yes, we could do that; that's what the prototype in <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19654">#19654</a> currently does.  What's weird about that choice is that we need logic to remove the Member group from the user and add the Full Member group, and vice versa, which may not be intuitive.  We can use transactions to make bugs where a user somehow ends up in neither, so the question is primarily one about what feels more clear/complex, but to me it feels simpler if the user's direct membership in the "Members" group doesn't change due to the day changing or the organization-level settings changing.</p>

<p>OK, for the @-mention reason I brought up on the other thread, I think @members should include all full members + non-full members. But the product difference for whether people are included directly or as a group seems very minor.</p>

<p>I agree, I think it makes more sense for ~everyone to be directly in "Members", and some people to additionally be in "Full members", than to be adding and removing people from "Members" as time passes.</p>

<p>I don't think it makes a big difference whether the profile lists "Member" in addition to "Full member". I suppose we could special-case removing "Member" from the list if it confuses people.</p>

<p>That points at a related question: will these groups live indexed by the same kind of string names as groups that users create? So e.g. I can't go create a group called "Administrators" (maybe I'm using Zulip at… a K-12 school or something, where there's a set of people called "administrators" unrelated to the Zulip concept by that name), because it would conflict with the system group.</p>
<p>If so, then that would make it hard to internationalize the names. It'd also make it hard to introduce additional system groups in the future, as the names may already be taken in some orgs.</p>

<p>If we keep all users (including full members) as direct members of Members group, then also it should be easy to just make an exception in UI to show both (Members and Full members) group or one. We can do this if we want to avoid the backend logic of removing user from <code>Members</code> group.</p>

<p>Yes, this is a problem currently as there is a constraint for names to be unique. So, if there is already a group named <code>Administrators</code> in an existing realm, then we cannot create the system group and for the other case as well that is mentioned above in quoted message.</p>

<p>Got it, yeah.</p>
<p>I think it's best if we find a way to have these groups be identified internally in a way that can't collide with user-created groups. And then when the groups are shown in the UI, we'd turn those internal identifiers into a corresponding UI string, which would get translated in the usual way.</p>

<p>One way to do this while still having the key for identifying a group consist of just a string would be to pick some delimiter character, or similar bit of formatting, that we'd forbid in the user-chosen names of groups. And then we'd use that delimiter in the internal names for the system groups.</p>

<p>From our design discussions, I think the desired end point is one where “system groups” are not special and the concept can eventually disappear. For example, if the user tries to create a stream, the code won’t implicitly look up the system group named moderators; it will look up the group that’s configured to manage the permissions for creating a stream, which will have been initialized to the moderators group but can be reconfigured to an arbitrary group.</p>
<p>I don’t think we explicitly addressed the members and full members groups in that discussion, but one way they could be addressed is with configuration options along the lines of</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatically add new members to this group: [members]</li>
<li>[x] After the new member waiting period, automatically add members to this group: [full members]<ul>
<li>New member waiting period: [3 days]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re only introducing the “system groups” concept as a transitional mechanism, so that we don’t have to introduce all those configuration options all at once. That suggests we should try to introduce it in a way that won’t prevent us from removing it later.</p>

<p>I feel like this might point, though, to a design where we keep these two system groups even in a future where we've turned owners/admins/moderators into ordinary user-managed groups.</p>
<p>One thing pushing me in that direction is that when I think about having a pair of groups like that, as an admin (and particularly if I'm not the only admin in the org)… I don't really want to also be potentially adding and removing users from those groups manually. I want to be able to use them as "all members" and "all full members", and not have to think about whether there are some accumulated discrepancies lying around from when someone removed someone from one of those groups because they didn't realize that wasn't how it's supposed to work.</p>

<p>The UI could prevent you from removing qualified users from the groups configured by these options. I can see it being potentially useful to be able to manually add a new user to full members (that discrepancy will disappear with time).</p>

<p>One other category of "special groups" would be the groups like "owners of #adehnert" -- I'm not sure if we'd want those cluttering up lists of groups, or potentially colliding with manually-created groups.</p>

<p>The proposed design doesn’t have groups like that. You can configure each stream-level permission to use any group, and multiple permissions per stream or across streams can point to the same group. I expect most organizations will just have a small handful of groups that are reused for everything.</p>

<p>We will make it easy to create a new group as needed: we let you do it directly in the dropdown, and perhaps automatically suggest a name that you can change. But we will not obscure the fact that group creation is happening. There are both UX reasons and performance reasons that we don't want to encourage the proliferation of thousands of tiny groups.</p>

<p>I think it's best if we find a way to have these groups be identified internally in a way that can't collide with user-created groups.

<p>From our design discussions, I think the desired end point is one where “system groups” are not special and the concept can eventually disappear. For example, if the user tries to create a stream, the code won’t implicitly look up the system group named moderators; it will look up the group that’s configured to manage the permissions for creating a stream, which will have been initialized to the moderators group but can be reconfigured to an arbitrary group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to add that I think we're only 50-80% confident that we will want to remove system groups after the end of the migration process. They're clearly a necessary crutch for migrating the permissions model without regressions.  </p>
<p>It seems possible that we may find it's useful to keep them as a long-term concept for onboarding reasons or to simplify documentation or because it makes LDAP data synchronization workflows cleaner.  But from a design perspective, we certainly want to preserve the option to eliminate them.</p>

<p>I think it is reasonable to name the system groups with names that users are unlikely to be using (or to want!) for existing groups, since that would prevent us from needing to do complex migration code to rename existing groups that conflict.</p>

<p>I think we should decorate groups names with an <code>@</code> since that is likely to be how they appear in the UI.  So here's some ideas with that in mind for machine-readable names:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>@Moderators</code> (Side question: Should group names be case-insensitive, like stream and topic names?).</li>
<li><code>@system:moderators</code> as Greg suggested above.</li>
<li><code>@role:moderators</code> (since these values do presently correspond to "roles" for users in the model).</li>
<li><code>@permission:moderators</code> (might hint more clearly that this includes everyone who has at least the "moderator" permission).</li>
</ul>

<p>I think it kinda depends on what the human-readable name/descriptions look like, and maybe we need to make a prototype toy UI for selecting a group (or displaying the current group) for a permission to have the right intuition here.</p>
<p>If we had names and descriptions for groups, for example, I could imagine display the group as e.g. <code>@permission:moderator</code> in a bubble (and that value is just fixed), and maybe when you mouse over it, we should a translated-into-your-personal-UI-language description that's "Group containing all users who have at least the moderator role", or something.</p>

<p>Well, I guess there's a range of possible reasons involving backwards-compatibility or convenience, and also around the Owner/Administrator roles specifically that would need to be thought about (E.g. we have probably 1-2 dozen things that administrators/owners can do exclusively that aren't controllable by a settings dropdown, and all of them would require some care in migrating to a groups-based world, and I don't know how urgent migrating those will feel).  I guess maybe I should have removed "at the end" from that sentence -- it does seem like whatever set of things we have should be implement in terms of groups.</p>

<p>As a random example: Currently we prevent you from removing the last organization owner or deactivating their account, and administrators (Who have the "deactivate account" permission in general) cannot deactivate owners.  This can become "users with the 'owner' permission are a group that can't have no active users in it" -- but it's probably a somewhat involved migration for each feature of this form.</p>

<p>Back the specific question of the maintenance mechanics for <code>full_members</code>, I'm leaning towards the model where we only toggle direct membership in the "full members" group and not the "members" group; that seems to me like just a simpler model.</p>
<p>I guess perhaps a case study of whether that's a good idea is what will happen when you change a user's role from "Member" to "Guest": It'd unconditionally remove the user from the "Members" group, and remove them from the "Full members" group if present?
