<p>Hey! A few months ago, I filed <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/17998">#17998</a> for putting up a warning banner when someone is about to @-mention the person they are talking to in a 1:1 PM conversation. The idea was to address the annoyance of messages in 1:1 PM threads being highlighted pink in a way that's not at all useful.</p>
<p>Thinking about it now while reviewing the PR (<a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/20614">#20614</a>), I wonder if we should do something more/something other than displaying a banner. Since we know that the message highlighting resulting from an @-mention is unlikely to be a good experience, perhaps we should do something about it more directly. Some ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maybe we could never highlight messages with @-mentions in 1:1 PMs? I'm having a hard time imagining a situation where the highlighting would be really desirable.</li>
<li>Maybe we could always treat @-mentions in 1:1 PMs as silent? This would affect not just highlighting, but also the @-mentions tab and notifications. I'm not a big fan of this option, because it seems unpredictable for users in a more risky way than (1).</li>
<li>Maybe we could show the banner and also automatically add <code>_</code> syntax when someone @-mentions their conversation partner? One thing I really like about the banner is that it teaches users about the existence of silent mentions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>I like #3, agree re learning about silent@ which is a really neat feature.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Like #3 but adds a one-click button/link into the message for the user to perform the change. That way, if the user meant to use @ they still can.</li>
</ol>
<p>LMK if you want me to code up any of these options so you can play around with them.</p>

<p>How would #3 work if I really want to @ someone (not @_) in PMs?<br>
I find @ mentioning myself to be really useful, because I can just look at the @ mentions tab to find important stuff later and being able to do the same with PMs is useful.</p>

<p>Is this in 1:1 PMs with yourself? With other people?</p>
<p>The @-mentioning yourself idea didn't occur to me. The way the issue was specced is that only @-mentions of your conversation partner would be affected  -- not yourself, unless you're talking to yourself. But maybe we want to special-case 1:1 PMs with yourself?</p>

<p>I don't think we should do any kind of special case here, treat me like we treat everyone else ie treat all @s the same, it's less confusing that way, but to answer your question I was thinking about both cases.<br>
I sometimes just say (bookmark for <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="9808">@Yash RE</span>) in conversations with other people.</p>
