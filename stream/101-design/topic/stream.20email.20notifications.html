<p>Should stream email notifications be "notifications always, even when on-line"? I feel like the only cases I know for email notifications are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy plug-in to compliance (e.g. if you've already got your email system hooked in to your compliance stuff)</li>
<li>Getting stragglers on board ("you don't have to download yet another app. You can use Zulip from your email")</li>
</ul>
<p>As a V2 we can add features like "wait 5 minutes before sending me an email notification", but I think that is actually a secondary use case.</p>

<p>We could certainly change that and then see whether people complain about "stream email notifications" being spammy (I would expect people to find them that way once they reconnect).  But I think before making a change of this form, we should debug the thing you mentioned in <a class="stream" data-stream-id="9" href="/#narrow/stream/9-issues">#issues</a> in case there's a bug here.</p>
