<p>So, many folks may have noticed this by now through getting the deprecation notice, but yesterday, we test-deployed here a change to deprecate the "C" hotkey, replacing it with "x", which is easier to type.  I'd like feedback on whether anyone saw the deprecation notice and was confused, and also on how folks are doing on retraining their muscle memory.</p>

<p>After pressing <code>C</code>, I got deprecation notice , I was expecting <code>Enter</code> key to work on that (Got it needs to be clicked via <code>Enter</code> key).<br>
And I only got that dialog one time. (I thinks this is intended  to show it only once). But I usually forget the change in practice if I am too fond of it. So again hitting <code>C</code> few times again, it its better to show it again :) <span class="emoji emoji-1f605" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span></p>
