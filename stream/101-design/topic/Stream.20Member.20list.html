<p>I'm a bit late on this but I've got a rough version ready:<br>

One quirk here is that if you're in the stream list and try a search, you only get results from members of that stream. I think this is useful, but if opinions differ maybe we can change that.</p>

<p>Might I suggest a toggle along the lines of what we had deployed here for the Unreads on the left side bar?<br>
The default for the buddy list could be stream members only, but the toggle could be used to switch to the list of all members on the realm</p>

<p>cool! One possibility might be to add a down-chevron next to <code>USERS</code> which would open a dropdown to switch it. Note that we may eventually add a third option as well. <br>
I tihnk search would ideally search all users. But that's not a blocker for merging this feature.</p>

<p>The default should just be all-users, and it should never switch automatically. If you've selected the "stream-members" options, and are not in a stream/topic narrow, it should show all users, but not switch the selection.</p>

<p>That... doesn't really make sense to me?<br>
because I don't understand why you'd have a selector visible that doesn't actually change anything...</p>
<p>How about I hide the chevron in non-stream views, and only keep it visible in stream views.<br>
If the user doesn't switch to stream views, they'll always see the all user list and the text will always say "USERS".<br>
If the user clicks the chevron and selects the stream list, they'll see the text "MEMBERS" and the stream member list _in stream narrows_ but see the text "USERS" and the all user list _in non-stream views_ and the widget will check and update accordingly.</p>
<p>ie what you were saying but they can only change from a stream narrow and the text always shows what actually is being viewed.</p>

<p>After thinking about this a bit, let's just start by doing this as a display setting, with the behavior I described.<br>
The setting can be</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>Who to show in users list
[All users in organization]
[Users in stream or PM]
</pre></div>


<p>I think there's an open question of what to do in All Messages, with "Users in stream or PM" selected. One option is to show the users in the conversation for the message under the blue box. Another option is to show all users. I think we may have to try both and see.</p>

<p>Oh... We want this for PMs too?<br>
I actually thought about it and honestly I think it might be a bit wasteful. Normally it means you have an entire list of 1 person for single PMs. Group PMs is a much stronger use case but even then it's just a few people...<br>
So, for single PMs would it be worth it to try it?</p>

<p>So, one last thing left here is the interleaved "is:private" view (what you get when you click Private messages):<br>
Should I just default to "All users" (which makes sense because it let's to you pick someone to pm) or would it be worth the effort to try and try something fancy like a list of all the people you've PMed yet?</p>

<li>Current approach is, we give the option to users if they want to show all the users in the right sidebar or only show the "selected stream or pm" users in the sidebar. </li>
<li>In PM with Tim, he suggested we should use the toggle button approach, which was first <a href="#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/stream.20member.20list/near/764391">discussed here</a>, and later <a href="#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/stream.20member.20list/near/764622">rejected here</a>.</li>

<p>Hmm, that could work... I think we'd need to figure out what text to put on the buttons to make it clear. The term "member" is used elsewhere to indicate permissions level (i.e. vs. admin or guest), so I think we should avoid it if we can.</p>
<p>"All users" seems good for the right-hand button.</p>

<p>The title currently shows <code>USERS</code> so text wise I would got with <code>SUBSCRIBED</code> vs <code>ALL</code>, or possibly something more along the lines of <code>RECIPIENTS</code> (<code>IN CONVERSATION</code>) to encompass PMs more fully.</p>

<p>How about if the current narrow is the stream we show <code>Subscriber</code> and if it's PM we show <code>Recipients</code>?</p>
<p>But then we need to decide what to show in the <code>All messages</code> view? Should we only show <code>All users</code>?</p>

<p>We could potentially show subscribers/recipients for the selected message/topic in the interleaved view. At the very least, we should have recipients-only lists as an option for any situation where we currently use fading to indicate who isn't subscribed. This includes opening the compose box from All messages, for instance.</p>

<p>The PR is almost ready.</p>
<p>Few more things to finalize,</p>
<ul>
<li>What should be the tooltip of <code>Recipients</code> and <code>All users</code> say? Currently, it's <code>Show users in your narrowed view</code> and <code>Show all users</code> respectively. </li>
<li>For an interleaved views, where there are no messages, what should we show in the <code>Recipients</code> list? (Currently, we show either previously rendered  recipients or all users.)</li>
<li>When the <code>Recipients</code> list is selected and we open compose box, should we grey out users which are not part of recipients?<br>
Something like this,<br>

<p>Maybe something like, "Show users subscribed to selected stream" or "Show conversation participants", depending on whether it's a stream or PM conversation? <code>Show all users</code> seems reasonable for the other one.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Showing all users makes sense to me.</p>

<p>When the <code>Recipients</code> list is selected and we open compose box, should we grey out users which are not part of recipients?</p>

<p>If <code>Recipients</code> is selected, we should just show the recipients there as well. The greyed out users should not be displayed at all.</p>

<p>Another bit of feedback playing with the PR: we should make it more clear that the "Recipients" and "All users" are buttons you can click on. Right now, the button that isn't selected just looks like header text. Probably both options should have a button border around them, and we can play with, e.g. fading out the one that's not selected to indicate which one is active.</p>

A down side of that approach would be that in orgs with a lot of users, you could potentially lose track of what type of users you're looking at if the section heading is not visible. We could add a secondary visual indication (background or color), but it might be too much.</p>

<p>Yeah, the feature should still work for PMs. <code>Subscribers</code>/<code>subscribed</code> seems kind of OK to me as a term for participants in a conversation, and I think it would be confusing if the heading changed as you navigate between streams and PMs. But curious what other folks think.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="7">Tim Abbott</span> and I just spend some time talking through the design here, and we have a proposal that we think is coherent. :)</p>
<p>The idea is to use a stacked view, and to get rid of the fading concept altogether. The overall setup would be:</p>
<hr>
<p>USERS <br>
[search box if open]</p>
<p><strong>Subscribers</strong> ▼ or <strong>Recipients</strong> ▼  <em>(collapsible list; heading depends on context as described below)</em><br>
Person A<br>
Person B<br>
...</p>
<p><strong>Others</strong> ▼ <em>(collapsible list)</em><br>
Person AA<br>
Person BB<br>
...</p>
<hr>
<p>Search results keep the headings that are present in the current view, e.g. you might see:</p>
<hr>
<p>USERS<br>
[T  ]<br>
<strong>Subscribers</strong> ▼ <br>
Tim</p>
<p><strong>Others</strong> ▼<br>
Tamara<br>
Terry</p>
<hr>
<p>Sending the proposed rules for how context defines what to show in a separate message. :)</p>

<li>
<p>If compose box is closed:<br>
   a) Show <strong>Subscribers</strong>/<strong>Others</strong> in a stream or topic narrow.<br>
   b) Show <strong>Recipients</strong>/<strong>Others</strong> in a PM thread narrow.<br>
   c) Don't show separate sections in any interleaved view, including <strong>All Messages</strong>, <strong>Recent topics</strong>, <strong>Starred</strong>, search views, etc. Just display all users as we do today.</p>

<li>
<p>If compose box is open:<br>
  a) If steam or PM addressees match the narrow being viewed, display as in (a)/(b) above. Note that this applies even if you are composing in a different topic from the one you're viewing, as long as it's in the same stream. But it wouldn't apply if you happen to be viewing a different same with the same subscriber list.<br>
  b) In the less frequent case when your compose box does <em>not</em> match the narrow being viewed, show <strong>Recipients</strong>/<strong>Others</strong> headings, with the <strong>Recipients</strong> defined by the <strong>compose box</strong> context. In this case we should also have a question mark next to <strong>Recipients</strong> to explain what's going on, at least when this happens in a non-interleaved view.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I would expect the sections to not re-expand when changing narrows; the use case is likely for folks who consider having the extra (and live-updating, since it resorts as new presence information comes in) information in the sidebar distracting.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>IMO the section headings should be sticky — do we want that as part of the spec?</p>

<p>I think so but am not entirely sure; I'd have a clearer sense of my opinion on that after being able to play with it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does this interact with long-term offline users?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a good question.  The simplest to do from a change management perspective would be to preserve our present behavior for what set of users appear in the sidebar, and then revisit that after we've done this migration.  But I think perhaps what I'd like to do is add an "And N additional offline users" line in each section, if there is anyone not being displayed; I think that would be straightforward and clear.</p>

<p>I'm starting to think that implementing this without making any changes to <code>buddy_list.js</code> (which is what <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19541">#19541</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/12846">#12846</a> do) is unlikely.<br>
<code>buddy_list.js</code> handles progressive scrolling / lazy loading,  so some care is needed while fiddling around there.</p>
<p>This design so involves removing compose fade entirely, which would be a change isolated from the specifics of the design, and hence, could be a good starting point. (Perhaps after making a janky V1 prototype).</p>

<p>I'd probably start with the prototype approach; what is hard here is figuring out the basics of the revised UX we want ignoring <code>compose_fade</code>.</p>

I have the following todos:</p>

- sticky headings
- line indicating long term idle users

<p>Very cool! A few thoughts on the visuals:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the standard way to use the caret for expanding/collapsing lists is to have it point to the right (&gt;) when the list is collapsed, and down when the list is expanded, so we should try that.</li>
<li>The headings look bigger/bolder than they should be to me, given what's around them. I think the should probably be smaller (or at least no bigger than) the USERS heading, which is the main one in that area. We could also consider bumping up the size and/or contrast on the USERS heading, in which case we'll need to change the STREAMS one to match.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the way, whatever we do with headings in the right sidebar should probably be matched in the left sidebar when we create sections for streams in <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19812">#19812</a>. So we can keep that in mind a bit as we're figuring this out, and then update <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19812">#19812</a> when we have a solution we like.</p>

<p>There are two commonly-seen designs for an expand-collapse widget. I took some notes on this a little while ago in a different context, so just went and tracked that message down -- <a href="#narrow/stream/19-documentation/topic/Improving.20API.20Docs.20UI/near/1239234">here it is</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Common designs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A down/up chevron at the end of the heading row. Material Design does this; search for "expand and collapse" <a href="https://material.io/components/lists">here</a>, or "expand a card" <a href="https://material.io/components/cards">here</a>.</li>
<li>A right/down chevron, or triangle, at the start of the heading row (before the heading text). This is common in big nested trees, like in the Chrome dev tools' elements view.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Material Design version has the chevrons pointing in the same directions as in the current prototype. But there are a few salient differences that I think are significant in making it look familiar and feel right:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The chevron goes at the end of the row (with appropriate padding), not right after the label.</p>
<p>This is especially important when there are several collapsed headings next to each other: you want the chevrons either at the end, or (as in that other common design) at the start before the headings, so that they're vertically aligned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The chevron is a lot wider, less acute. (And in Material specifically, it's also a chevron, not a filled triangle.)</p>
<p>The Material icons are open-source, so we can simply <a href="https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.query=expand">use them</a>.</p>
<p>(In designs where it's a triangle instead of a chevron, it's still a lot wider, less acute. I think it's usually about a right angle at the tip. In the prototype, it looks like an equilateral (60°) or maybe even more acute.)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Yeah, I think this is actually pretty important in the case where the section is collapsed. As is, it looks like this: <a href="/user_uploads/2/9a/qJBpMEZDVX8X0RvJq14eCzqO/image.png">image.png</a> </p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/9a/qJBpMEZDVX8X0RvJq14eCzqO/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/9a/qJBpMEZDVX8X0RvJq14eCzqO/image.png"></a></div><p>or this: <a href="/user_uploads/2/34/CGyeX__9XtZb90pr1Xv1VfT5/image.png">image.png</a> </p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/34/CGyeX__9XtZb90pr1Xv1VfT5/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/34/CGyeX__9XtZb90pr1Xv1VfT5/image.png"></a></div><p>which look quite a lot like there are no subscribers at all.</p>
<p>(Then once we have it in the case where the section is collapsed, we should also have it when uncollapsed: it's helpful summary information in itself, plus it avoids the heading changing on collapse/uncollapse.)</p>

<p>I'm still working on this, I was hoping to have a WIP PR yesterday, but had a small hiccup when I realized that <code>list_cursor.js</code> is fairly closely coupled to the structure of <code>buddy_list.js</code>, but also used in other places (this means that pressing <code>w</code> and using <code>↓</code> or <code>↑</code>only works on the "recipient" section and not the "others" section).<br>
Other todos are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To completely remove <code>compose_fade_users.js</code>, the app currently seems to depend on a side effect of importing <code>compose_fade_helpers</code> via <code>compose_fade_users</code> and <code>buddy_data</code>.</li>
<li>To add puppeteer tests. (Node tests pass and maintain coverage on each commit. Every commit also clears linter checks.)</li>
<li>To reduce and optimize <code>activity.redraw()</code> calls.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some changes that are even further away are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To redo lazy loading (delayed insertion of users into html, based on scroll).</li>
<li>To add a line counting the number of long term idle users. (Although, this isn't likely to be difficult since we have <code>people.get_non_active_human_ids()</code>.)</li>

<p>I think PR <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/20072">#20072</a> could use some attention now, the profiling results are not optimistic but it might be helpful to see if it's noticeably worse in a real environment, maybe test deploy?</p>

<p>A few things I've noticed:</p>
<ul>
<li>It wasn't obvious to me that the "46" is just online subscribers; I think "Online subscribers (46)" or "Subscribers (46 online) would be a better label.  The "Others" label also needs work, since for an organization like this one with long-term idle users, it is by default the users who've been offline for less than 2 weeks or something like that, not everyone else in the organization.  Maybe "Recently active subscribers (N)" except that's too long.</li>
<li>We need a bigger vertical gap before the "Others" label -- I had a hard time finding it when scrolling down.</li>
<li>The rerender that happens when the data refreshes every minute seems to lose your scroll position by jumping you to the top.</li>
<li>When you're filtering with a search, the lists are now "All subscribers" vs. "Everyone else in the organization", and that's not clear at all either.</li>

<p>Hmm, "recently active" is also confusing because it might imply "active in the past couple of hours" rather than "active in the past couple of weeks".</p>
<p>I suppose we could use a tooltip on the "Others" heading to explain what it means?</p>

<p>So, there's actually a few things that happen here:<br>
1) Our presence data just excludes all the long term idle users, so we don't count or show them.<br>
2) Each list shows only active (filled green circle) and idle (half filled orange circle) users if the size of the list would otherwise be greater than 600 elements.<br>
3) The count is only the users we're actually showing in the list.</p>
<p>So, some of the trouble here could be handled by:</p>
<ul>
<li>implementing the "... and N additional users" line, and including both the offline users and the longer term idle users,</li>
<li>adding the count from that line to the total that we show.</li>
</ul>
<p>Renaming (eg to <code>Subscribers (61 online)</code>) also makes sense to me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"it is by default the users who've been offline for less than 2 weeks or something like that, not everyone else in the organization. Maybe "Recently active subscribers (N)" except that's too long."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There should almost always be some online or idle users in that list as well. It's a list of everyone that's not subscribed, but it follows the same rules as above.</p>

<p>I noticed the following bug earlier today:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you hover over a name in the buddy list, such that the tooltip shows up and (slight guesswork) something causes the buddy list to redraw, the tooltip will be left orphaned and move to the top left of the screen.</li>
<li>the above, but the tooltip might get stuck exactly where it is, even after you move the mouse away. (it'll jump to the top left if you scroll).</li>

<p>I think there is some problem with translating "subscribers".<br>
I see "Mitglieder" in the user list, which is quite misleading, as I assumed at first that this shows organisation wide informations (e.g. full-members, members, guests, ...) like Discord does.<br>
There might be the need to either translate "Subscribers" correctly to "Abonnenten", use "Recipients" ("Empfänger" in german) everywhere (at least in some languages) or append a "Stream" as "Stream Mitglieder" could not be miss understood.<br>
But I think even "Abonnenten" might be a bit confusing, too, as it is (with the exception being Youtube and Instagram) most of the time used for a paid subscription. Also it is not used in the stream details window.</p>
<p>I personally like "Stream Mitglieder" most for the user list, but would like to keep "Mitglieder" in the stream details window.</p>
<p>I wrote this in this stream as I guess that this might be a problem with multiple languages and not unique to german.</p>

<p>So, if anyone is watching, you'll have noticed that this has gone idle for a bit, this is because other things were being prioritized, it might stay that way a bit longer (unless someone says this is more important), but I've left this in a state that should be easy for me to pick up again.</p>

<p>Well the actual code knows that the scrollHeight of the parent is equal to the sum of scrollHeights of the children and I had to figure out the right way to mock that. That's all. Took a while and a couple of poor approaches to get it right.</p>

<p>I just had an idea for how to improve the UX in <a href="#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/Stream.20Member.20list/near/1279496">this case </a>... Instead of filtering out everyone who's less than orange, let's first show the first 600 people based on existing sorting order (so orange and above will get precedence) and then filter out the rest.<br>
This means that if you have a stream with 800 subscribers, 798 of whom have not logged in for over a week, we'll show 600 subscribers instead of just 2.</p>

<p>It wasn't obvious to me that the "46" is just online subscribers; I think "Online subscribers (46)" or "Subscribers (46 online) would be a better label.  The "Others" label also needs work, since for an organization like this one with long-term idle users, it is by default the users who've been offline for less than 2 weeks or something like that, not everyone else in the organization.  Maybe "Recently active subscribers (N)" except that's too long.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah! This is actually a bug in the logic I wrote. The way I'd written it, the "others" list gets created by taking all the user_ids and then just filtering out the "users" ids.<br>
That's the wrong thing to do in the case of large orgs, where the "users" list get shrinked (ie all currently idle ids are removed) because it makes people show up in the "others" list when they're not supposed to.</p>

<p>let's say that I notice that many users of my organization do not open Zulip Desktp in full screen mode, and the user list is hidden by default, if then when they open it they see two different lists of users, it could be a further element of confusion if they wanted to click directly on a user to start a private chat.</p>

<p>The reason I didn't do just 2 headers is that if you have <strong>Users of X</strong> and <strong>All other users</strong> is that I thought we need a single panel header which has a global user filter.

<p>the subscribers theme must be the same as the selected Stream to make it clearer</p>

<p>So, I just pushed to <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/20072">#20072</a>. There's minor changes that need to be made in terms of styling the section headings, and the "... and N additional offline users" texts (these do not currently include long term idle users, just those shrunk out of the list when it's too big).</p>
<p>But I was wondering if we could start reviewing the JavaScript implementation. I think the biggest obstacle is going to be this commit <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/20072/commits/d9fcbfdbc7c45b4a8cb79fe80af641c90b969ab9">hack: Add ListCursorWithScrollOverride hack.</a> which is essentially just how I've currently gotten arrow key navigation to work currently...</p>

<p>Is the proposal here to figure out how to add the long term idle users, or to change the section headings to indicate that they are not being counted?</p>

<p>The prior, I don't believe it would not be an awful lot of work, it's just that those users aren't currently readily available to that code.</p>
