<p>Zulip desktop seems to weirdly interleave comments from topics.  Consider this screenshot:</p>
<p><a href="/user_uploads/2/4d/dK2qY5fAcBd7mx4zboc-qKqG/Capture.png">Capture.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/4d/dK2qY5fAcBd7mx4zboc-qKqG/Capture.png" title="Capture.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/4d/dK2qY5fAcBd7mx4zboc-qKqG/Capture.png"></a></div>

<p>Is this the intended behavior? It seems odd for the feed to bounce back and forth between two different discussions, showing each reply under a comment from an unrelated thread.  </p>
<p>There's also an arbitrarily large region of empty space between the input box and the comments (and the adjacent comment is not even from the thread that I am replying to).  Other chat apps generally keep related comments together.  So I was wondering about the rationale behind this design.</p>

<p>This is a stream view - you can zoom into (view) one of the topics by clicking on its title. There are shortcut keys for this - s/S will zoom in/out (in zulip-terminal we also added z for this to toggle in/out). In the webapp (and presumably desktop?) you can do alt-left/right to go back/forward between views too, just like going through web page history.</p>
