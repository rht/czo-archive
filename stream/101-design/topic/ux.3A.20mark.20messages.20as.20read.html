<p>Hi</p>
<p>Sometimes I spend a couple of days without opening Zulip chat and there are tons of unread messages. I try to read a couple and dismiss the popup asking me to mark all as read. But when I get tired of reading, I just want to skip to the end and I have never found a button to do that, so I kept scrolling the messages. I have found the option to mark all messages as read on the left menu but I don't think is very intuitive. Wouldn't be better if that option was somewhere near the message area?</p>

<p>Well, there are tradeoffs here.  You can scroll to the bottom of a message view or use the End key to do that for an individual view (which in the "All messages" view marks everything as read)</p>

<p>But we do need to be cautious about making it too easy to accidentally mark everything as read.</p>

<p>One thing we're likely to do very soon is a change similar to <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/d79a7a8c35bdfbe8dd776f8c0acb6069422d2d7c" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/d79a7a8c35bdfbe8dd776f8c0acb6069422d2d7c">d79a7a8c35bdfbe8dd776f8c0acb6069422d2d7c</a> replacing the modal for unread messages; I think that should be a fairly quick change for anyone interested, and will help a lot since users can just leave that notice up until they're ready to hit it.</p>

<p>yeah I was thinking in something like that actually. When I finish the issue I'm currently working on, if none still hasn't done this I could do it  :)<br>
Should I open an issue for this?</p>
