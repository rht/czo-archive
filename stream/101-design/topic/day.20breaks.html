<p>I was chatting with someone who is familiar with zulip from czo. She was saying the main thing that made zulip's conversation model confusing at the beginning was not topics, but the the fact that even in topic narrows you have recipient blocks (due to day breaks). </p>
<p>So you think you have an idea of what recipient blocks are, but then you get to the topic narrow and find out "ok, it's something else .. maybe each recipient block is a conversation?" which sets you on the wrong track. </p>
<p>I do think in general having the date changes use the same visual semantics as stream/topic changes is not great. Figuring out that new recipient block means "change of topic OR change of date" does seem considerably trickier than if it were one or the other. And since a decent fraction of conversations last a day or more (or if you're remote, may go over midnight in your timezone even when the conversation only lasts a few hours), they show up all over the place. </p>
<p>How hard would it be to change it so that we didn't start a new recipient block on day change? E.g. something like what the mobile app does.</p>

<p>Recipient blocks are for different topics when you're in an interleaved view.</p>

<p>I have lots of thoughts on day dividers, since I was around when we did our last iteration on improving them.</p>

<p>First, I think the problem Rishi diagnosed with them is an interesting category of problem, where it's a problem that people might not even be able put their finger on as to why it's making the reading experience less pleasant.  Or it doesn't feel like a bad enough problem to complain.</p>

<p>One thing that date dividers accomplish, although maybe poorly, is that you don't have to repeat the date in every message.</p>

<p>That saves some significant real estate.  (You could just show dates on hover, but that can be really confusing too, making it appear that messages are out of order when you only see times.)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, if you have several screenfuls of messages per day, our current design still makes it a bit difficult to know what date it is, unless you look at the date in the floating recipient bar at the top.</p>

<p>For topic-only views, I've argued that the FRB is just clutter, but it does have a tiny bit of signal, which is the date in the right hand side.  But of course that goes right into Rishi's observation that we have the recipient bars denoting two different kinds of division.</p>

<p>Also, if there is a huge break in a feed (like weeks or months), we don't really make the more prominent than a 24-hour break.</p>

<p>I'll also re-emphasize a point that Rishi made, which is that for some communities "midnight" is sort of an arbitrary concept.  If I'm catching up on conversations that took place overnight in the other hemisphere, the "midnight" block doesn't do much for me.  If, on the other hand, I worked in an office with no remote people, midnight's a much more useful cutoff.</p>

<p>For the technical implementation side of things, the code dealing with message dividers is some of our more complex code.  Adding dividers is easy enough conceptually, but we have added complications like incoming messages and various drawing optimizations.</p>

<p>If we wanted to go with a very simple experiment--allow folks to turn off day dividers--I think we could do that pretty easily.  We would just have <code>are_days_different</code> (or whatever the function is called) always return <code>false</code> if you don't want day dividers.  And we already show the date in the time hover, so users could find it if they really needed it.</p>

<p>A more difficult thing to implement would be re-styling the dividers somehow.</p>

<p>So the short answer is "pretty easy."  Assuming we're ok with tradeoffs.</p>

<p>We'd need to do some styling work, but we do already have these dividers.<br>

<p>I feel like I've seen some app with a message feed (Slack maybe?) that show the date dividers kind of like a tooltip and then hide them once you stop scrolling.  It's enough to alert you that you've gone back in the feed without cluttering things.</p>

<p>Another thing that still confuses me at times is that we mention the current time on the right and the last message time on the left, and since I end up seeing the left text first along with reading the message, I tend to relate that to be the current message's time, and have to consciously think to read the right one and remember which is which.</p>
