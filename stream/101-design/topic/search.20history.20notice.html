<p>Hey! <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="58">@Steve Howell (showell)</span> and I noticed that our search experience is pretty confusing when the are (initially) no search results. In particular,  the page looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="/user_uploads/2/26/hjE2udQKZ9SwD_AQwbwjKhTO/Screen-Shot-2021-10-13-at-12.49.05-PM.png">Screen-Shot-2021-10-13-at-12.49.05-PM.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/26/hjE2udQKZ9SwD_AQwbwjKhTO/Screen-Shot-2021-10-13-at-12.49.05-PM.png" title="Screen-Shot-2021-10-13-at-12.49.05-PM.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/26/hjE2udQKZ9SwD_AQwbwjKhTO/Screen-Shot-2021-10-13-at-12.49.05-PM.png"></a></div><p>There seem to be a few problems here:</p>
<ul>
<li>"End or results" is an odd description for a situation when there are no results at all.</li>
<li>The information is hard to process. The "End of results" alert doesn't really make sense until you've seen the "No search results" text below it, but it's also easy to visually skip over.</li>
<li>It's confusing why we didn't just search all public streams in the first place, if that's what one should do.</li>
<li>As described in <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/17183">#17183</a>, it's weird not to include private streams with shared history in the expanded search.</li>
</ul>
<p>One thought is that perhaps we should automatically search all available history when no results are found in the <a href="http://17183">initial user history search</a> we do? That would at least reduce the frequency of this weird experience, so that we would only need to figure out how to make it work well when there <em>are</em> some initial search results. We could tell the users that we're expanding the search scope, potentially.</p>

<p>Interesting! I think this is a good idea. It will require some care to clearly tell the user what happened.</p>

<p>It seems a lot like a thing that Google web search does, where when you make a search that it thinks is a typo, it just goes ahead and does the search it thinks you meant -- but with a clear notice at the top, and a link to do the actual search you typed if that's really what you meant.</p>
<p>I sometimes find that behavior annoying, but I think more often I find it convenient.</p>

<p>It might be both simpler and (arguably) better for the user to <strong>not</strong> automatically expand the search, but instead propose a better search.</p>

<p>That's what we currently do, right? Do you mean just reworking the message to foreground that more?</p>

<p>I think having that string switch from "End of results" to "No results" when there are none makes sense as a small wording tweak, as well.</p>

<p>(Plus the better search should be more better than it is -- that's <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/17183">#17183</a> as mentioned above.)</p>

<p>Ah, yes, I guess we do.  Yeah, I guess just make it a little more obvious (like possibly a button).</p>
