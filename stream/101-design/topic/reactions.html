<p>So, we have deployed here an experimental branch, which shows the person who gave a reaction if a message has just 1 reaction on it.</p>

<p>(Just provided an example above).  The intent for this is that it should help make it easier to understand a conversation without needing to mouse over the message in the common case where you suggest an idea (E.g. when debugging) and the person reacts to respond.</p>

<p>Now, there's a few questions that I think could use discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we need to worry about this discouraging folks from doing "the first reaction" in a public place, because it might feel like they're standing out</li>
<li>If there are multiple reaction types on a message, should that still show the names (as the current implementation does) or should it only show names when the message has just 1 reaction, total.</li>
</ul>

<p>Can we do something like this:<br>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-email="f2016561@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in" data-user-id="5140">@Aman Agrawal</span> I think that probably doesn't make sense; it's sorta a rare case and there's value in predictability of how emoji are displayed.</p>

<p>One idea I had was to just use the first 2-3 characters of the name, instead of the whole name. That might make the "first reaction" seem less intense, but still help with the "check if the person you're talking to is the one that reacted" situation.</p>
<p>It would also make it easier to display several names, if several people reacted.</p>

<p>The noise it adds to the reading experience to me outweighs the occasional need to see who did react to that.<br>
It is also inconsistent - why do we hide that information for two people?</p>

<p>I think we are solving a simple problem with the wrong solution.<br>
Problem - it takes too long from hover to showing the users that reacted (default title display for a browser is a few seconds)<br>
Simple solution in response to the concrete problem - custom tooltip that shows immediately on hover.</p>



<a name="506099"></a>
<h4><a href="https://chat.zulip.org#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/reactions/near/506099" class="zl"><img src="https://rht.github.io/czo-archive/assets/img/zulip.svg" alt="view this post on Zulip" style="width:20px;height:20px;"></a> Boris Yankov <a href="https://rht.github.io/czo-archive/stream/101-design/topic/reactions.html#506099">(Feb 19 2018 at 00:20)</a>:</h4>
<p>A slightly more advanced solution would be to show <code>:emoji: 1</code> and on hover it becomes <code>:emoji: Boris</code>. That can extend to several people too.</p>



<a name="506101"></a>
<h4><a href="https://chat.zulip.org#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/reactions/near/506101" class="zl"><img src="https://rht.github.io/czo-archive/assets/img/zulip.svg" alt="view this post on Zulip" style="width:20px;height:20px;"></a> Boris Yankov <a href="https://rht.github.io/czo-archive/stream/101-design/topic/reactions.html#506101">(Feb 19 2018 at 00:21)</a>:</h4>
<p>In addition, we need to start designing these features with the mobile client in mind. The experiences on web vs mobile can differ somewhat wherever necessary, but for the majority of the cases we should keep it consistent.</p>



<a name="506103"></a>
<h4><a href="https://chat.zulip.org#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/reactions/near/506103" class="zl"><img src="https://rht.github.io/czo-archive/assets/img/zulip.svg" alt="view this post on Zulip" style="width:20px;height:20px;"></a> Boris Yankov <a href="https://rht.github.io/czo-archive/stream/101-design/topic/reactions.html#506103">(Feb 19 2018 at 00:26)</a>:</h4>
<p>Another drawback: in addition to the feeling of the first reaction being too public (or maybe that you are showing off too much)... the second one feels the opposite. It is like I am removing the name of the person that just reacted.</p>



<a name="506104"></a>
<h4><a href="https://chat.zulip.org#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/reactions/near/506104" class="zl"><img src="https://rht.github.io/czo-archive/assets/img/zulip.svg" alt="view this post on Zulip" style="width:20px;height:20px;"></a> Boris Yankov <a href="https://rht.github.io/czo-archive/stream/101-design/topic/reactions.html#506104">(Feb 19 2018 at 00:27)</a>:</h4>
<p>Final suggestion: on hover, without any delay, show a vertical list of avatars + user names</p>



<a name="506138"></a>
<h4><a href="https://chat.zulip.org#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/reactions/near/506138" class="zl"><img src="https://rht.github.io/czo-archive/assets/img/zulip.svg" alt="view this post on Zulip" style="width:20px;height:20px;"></a> Tim Abbott <a href="https://rht.github.io/czo-archive/stream/101-design/topic/reactions.html#506138">(Feb 19 2018 at 02:26)</a>:</h4>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-email="borisyankov@gmail.com" data-user-id="284">@Boris Yankov</span> the problem we're trying to solve is more one of keyboard interactions.  If you're primarily using Zulip via the keyboard, checking who reacted is one the main things that forces you to reach for the mouse.  It's possible this will end up as a setting.</p>
<p>But I'd like more feedback from the community on whether the concern about "feeling public" is something folks actually feel, as opposed to something I imagined.</p>

<p>Definitely felt the same, and also the additional thing of 'hiding the user' when you are the 2nd voter.</p>

<p>Also, this looks like a solution for the custom case where only one person voted.</p>

<p>I'm still not sure how I feel, but I think two small changes would make it better:</p>
<ul>
<li>The spacing between the emoji and the name is a bit too much, I think </li>
<li>The blue link styling makes the reaction too prominent, I think. So maybe we can make the name grey, and blue only on hover?</li>
</ul>

<p>If this is to help people using the keyboard why not a shortcut that shows the names?<br>
Not only will it not deteriorate the experience of the other users, it will work for more than one people reacting.</p>

<p>Just to add some color to my opinions, I actually stumbled upon this first on mobile web, and I thought it was a mobile-web-only fix.  (Yes, I still use mobile web, and the reactions there basically unusable if you wanted to know who actually reacted.)  So I was excited.</p>
<p>On the laptop I am basically ambivalent.  I like how the initial reaction is a bit less work to see, but I agree it's a bit over prominent.</p>

<p>The thumbs-up reaction is by far the reaction I notice the most.  I like that it saves a tiny bit of screen real estate, plus the 50 variations of saying thank you and yes rarely add much signal.  (And when people are especially thankful or have a more nuanced version of "yes," they tend to use text responses.)  So I've actually been more or less happy with the status quo.</p>

<p>I don't think this achieves the goal of making it easier to see who is reacting. For starters, the avatars would be around 18x18 which is really, really tiny, and with multiple people reacting you're either making the pills quite wide and visually heavy by having the emoji and then multiple images, until suddenly they become comparably understated when you switch to numbers only (without avatars at all). And if you wanted to make them less overstated, you could overlap the images and then destroy most of the ability to see who actually reacted in the avatars (eg it would only be useful from an ornamentation perspective).</p>

The two part pill design does seem like an improvement over the first prototype, although I'm not sure how it fares against the text only approach. One thing to be considered is the amount of users that use a gravatar for their profile image, i'm not aware of how much the percentage of these users are, but if they are in a considerable proportion, displaying gravatars beside the reaction wouldn't add value to the feature.</p>

<p>just a quick idea, but since keyboard oriented people (i'm one too) would usually look at the currently focused message, maybe unfolding the reactions (displaying all the names in full, grouped by reaction) when the message is focused, could fill the need, it would take more real estate as now (but mostly horizontally, which is currently free space, and only vertically if there are a <em>lot</em> of reactions) and fold again as soon as the user jump to the next message?</p>

I imagine we would never expand vertically, and just use <code>...</code>s or similar (and require the user to use the mouse) in the situations where the expansion wouldn't fit on one line.</p>
