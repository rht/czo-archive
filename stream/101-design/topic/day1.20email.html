<p>Currently we send our day1 email an hour after the user signs up. While I think I understand the motivation (let the user play around with stuff before they see the welcome email), I feel like that has a much higher chance of feeling like spam than if the email is more clearly transactional (sent as a part of the signup process, i.e. with no delay). </p>
<p>Also, I think an hour is rarely the right time frame for re-engaging with a product. if I'm checking out a product, I'm usually giving it something like 10 minutes; by an hour later I'm on to something else.</p>

<p>dropbox paper sent me their four welcome emails on days: 0, 2, 5 ,7 (actually, wed, fri, mon, wed, which suggests an algorithm like "add 2 days and round up to Monday if it's the weekend"). I think that'd be a good algorithm for us as well?</p>

<p>Seems reasonable.</p>

<p>Looking for other models, I searched my email for messages from Front -- they seem pretty good at this.</p>
<p>It looks like they sent me just one timed email, a few days in -- a detailed pitch for the one feature they're really keen on convincing people to use (which is to connect their individual work inbox).</p>

<p>But then they pretty often send announcements of new features -- like 1x/mo or more.</p>

<p>good idea, thanks for the Front data. <br>
My current thought is that we should send three onboarding emails:</p>
<ul>
<li>Welcome: link to getting started guides, mobile and desktop apps, ideally a "thanks for being a part of the zulip community"</li>
<li>Topics: getting the user to like/understand topics</li>
<li>Keyboard shortcuts: another shot at teaching them n, r, End, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>And yeah, I've found the Front new feature announcements surprisingly useful.</p>
