<p>We'd want to be consistent on both side bars, that said, if the stream search was "always open", we could use the entire <code>streams_header</code> to open the stream config, which would be an improvement in my eyes <span aria-label="thinking" class="emoji emoji-1f914" role="img" title="thinking">:thinking:</span>. Idk though.</p>

<p>One consider is that on small realms (and all realms start as small realms) the search features are not really as useful to new users.  So for brand new realms I think there's a strong argument that we're doing the right thing to reduce clutter.  But I also wish the features were a bit more discoverable.</p>

<p>I agree! On our self-hosted version, I have simply made it always visible with CSS. I do not think it adds clutter. I have also removed the welcome bot messages and the tutorials, which I thought were adding unnecessary  noise / clutter.</p>
<p>When I first accessed a Zulip chat, I saw the users on the right, the streams on the left, the search at the top and the compose box at the bottom. It all seemed really clear and intuitive. No navigation barriers either. I knew immediately what I could do and did not think I needed any doc, sensing that I would be able to discover new functions with time.</p>
<p>I then dutifully read the bot messages, clicked on the blinking thingies and thought they were a distraction. This is why I removed them all. New users log in, find a blank slate and get going (I hope). There is beauty in simplicity, especially if it is the result of a simplifying process. </p>
<p>I think that, as much as feasible, the very basic functions should all be directly accessible. The search box above the list of users is one of those in my view and does not waste much space, at least on wide screens. Something could also be done to make the compose box more visible, although this is a more complex issue. To illustrate: as part of our testing, I asked someone to invite me to a video session and he wondered how to do this. I pointed out that he'd find out after accessing the compose box. Then came his answer: how am I supposed to know this?</p>
<p>So, my point is this: the way Zulip implements the discovery of the advanced functions works really well. Casual users will not waste time on them; persistent users will find out progressively, without being overloaded and without reading docs. Having said this, I believe the hiding of functions happens too early in the discovery process. There is still space to display the basic, important ones. The video chat is one of them.</p>

<p>Yeah I think hiding search inputs by default harms UX in general, because it's not obvious where to type something.</p>

<p>I'd certainly open to making the users/streams filter widgets always visible.  For context, they were hidden as part of an effort to make the UI less cluttered / more accessible feeling, so we should keep that in mind when thinking about tradeoffs.  </p>
<p>We do have the magnifying glass icons hinting that search is available for anyone curious, though.</p>
