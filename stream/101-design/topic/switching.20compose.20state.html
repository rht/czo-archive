<p>Semi-relatedly, has there been brainstorming in the past about whether there's a way to make it easier to transition between composing stream messages and composing private messages? </p>

<p>Zulip actually supported this feature in like 2013!  It got removed like 6 months later over my objections, basically because the UI for it was confusing.  I am of the perspective that we should allow it; we just need the right iconography for it.</p>

<p>assuming such a UI is actually "switching" between compose-for-stream and compose-pm, it would still make sense to have ways to proactively enter it in the state of choice.  (uh, meaning, "start new PM" should maybe remain a separate button somewhere somehow)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yeah, me too.  One common scenario for me is that I want to quote a message from a stream and reference it in a PM, so I use the <code>&gt;</code> hotkey to start a reply, but then I need to do <code>Ctrl+A, Ctrl+X, Esc, X, {specify recipient}, Ctrl+V</code> to get my content into the new reply (or something equivalent using the mouse).  Whereas if I wanted to do the same thing and send to a private stream, it's a lot simpler.</p>

<p>maybe keep both icons visible, but with some selection indication? (so it doesn't look like you're labelling a stream message with a user icon, or vice versa)</p>

<p>i am curious how many people get to the PM compose screen from the "New Private Message" button vs clicking on the user in the main view vs clicking on the user in one of the sidebars. i feel like the right sidebar is the most intuitive place to go to start a PM, but I could be wrong about that.</p>

<p>I feel like the left sidebar makes the most sense to slack users, and just replying to a PM in an interleaved mode is the most obvious for me. both have the limitation that they only work for people already talking to you. the right sidebar feels slower to me, and I think I'm just used to using the button if I'm starting a new conversation. (both at least can involve autocomplete to find the right person)</p>

<p>I personally never use the right side bar, because I find it too overwhelming, and would rather rather pick from Zulip autocomplete. The right sidebar is probably nicer to use in a smaller org.</p>

<p>I generally navigate through <strong>Private mesages</strong> if I've talked to someone before, because that way I don't have to figure out if I've got the right person. (Again, this is mostly a large org challenge.)</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/24878">#24878</a> is the current compose box design. The DM switcher is going into the stream dropdown menu (which is why that PR is a blocker for the feature).</p>
