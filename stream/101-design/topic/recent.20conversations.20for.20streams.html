<p>I created a draft PR for a recent conversations view for streams and would love if folks played around with it and gave some feedback!</p>

<ul>
<li>There's still work to do to add the setting/option to also access the interleaved view.</li>
<li>I have an open question about if it's worth the extra work to make each stream's filter defaults stored separately (see code comment).</li>
<li>There's some weird stuff going on with the highlight of the buttons, but that's present on CZO as well. (and probably should be looked into)</li>

<p>I understand there has been a desire for this kind of feature, and users find the interleaved views confusing. I use recent conversations myself on czo, if rarely using any of the filters, so it's interesting to see this idea <span aria-label="+1" class="emoji emoji-1f44d" role="img" title="+1">:+1:</span></p>

<p>From the recording my first take was to be a little wary of how what is primarily (historically) the message list area will now be flipping between that and more variations of the recent conversations views. I think that my feeling of that may have arisen since they seem like different views - they're filtered to a stream, and titled as such, but it's unclear if they're actually the same UI. For example, can I adjust the title like a search term and recover recent conversations? Search from recent conversations can't filter to a stream right now; will it be adjusted so I can get from there to a stream version?</p>

<p>Another query would be how much purpose the expanding-topic list in the left panel retains - it is less detailed and featureful than this new view, even if in a topic narrow it enables switching between a subset of topics. However, the filtering of the stream topics in the new view presumably doesn't apply to the left panel topic list? Would it be simpler to drop that list if this feature is enabled?</p>

<p>I like the experiment here, Evy. One question that occurs to me about such a view is what can actually be <em>done</em> there. Like, why might a user want to interact with topics from that view versus the LSB? As things stand, the LSB provides more, and more obvious, actions on a given topic than the view inspired by Recent conversations.</p>

<p>The idea is to never land user in the interleaved view where things can be confusing to new users. Also, recent topics offers a much more organized and informative view of a topic helping you decide which topic can be more important to read first or read at all right now.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="5140">@Aman (amanagr)</span> are you thinking we need that for stream recent conversations? Can you explain why?</p>
<p>If you had something like that screenshot, what would happen if you selected more streams or removed the stream filter -- would the narrow change? As a user, I expect clicking on a stream to show me only topics from that stream and not be part of some bigger filtering thing.</p>

<p>Exactly  -- the main motivation for me was to replace the interleaved view. But there are also other motivations like showing all the extra information that Recent Conversations shows (people participating in the conversation, filtering by muted or participated, etc). I also don't like that the side bar involves an extra click to search for topic names, and Recent Conversations has that built into the main view.</p>

<p>Aman followed up on this a little, but to clarify:</p>
<ul>
<li>recent conversations is special in that the search area is disconnected from the area below (which is special in not being a typical "message list")</li>
<li>recent conversations search starts from nothing, independently of the recent conversations filters</li>
<li>regular message list narrows for streams, topics, etc. have the search area title prefilled with the narrow title (eg. stream name)</li>
<li>regular message list narrows allow editing of the search, to remove a simple narrow filter (eg. stream, topic) or add to it</li>
</ul>
<p>Your prototype shows recent conversations with a stream title. That requires reconciling the above points, to make it clear how the user interacting with the search bar will now behave:</p>
<ul>
<li>will it not prefill with the stream filter text, like the existing recent conversations? That would be inconsistent with the title being present</li>
<li>so will it prefill with the stream filter text?</li>
<li>what does hitting enter on the stream search text do? Does it go to a stream narrow or back to the Stream+recentconversations view?</li>
<li>if I delete any prefilled stream filter text, would that take me to recent conversations or all messages?</li>
<li>what if I add another search term?</li>
</ul>
<p>The simplest solution might be to introduce a search term that specifically refers to recent conversations, ie. enables an interactive additional search feature. Then we could have a prefilled element for recent conversations (eg. <code>is:filtered-recently</code>), and a stream version would combine that with the stream name, and also enable combinations with a topic name, or whatever else.</p>

<p>Ah I see yeah so there's some issue here around search. I'd expect searching for a stream to show me all messages for a stream, i.e. the interleaved view. I'd want clicking on the stream to show me something different though.</p>

<p>The reason I find it not intuitive is it that to me, searching should always show a result that is the messages which correspond to the search. If there aren't messages in the view, I wouldn't expect search to have anything in it.</p>

<p>I personally think search filters should work this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recent Conversations always has an empty search bar (no filters), both or org-wide and only stream-wide.</li>
<li>If the search bar is empty and you hit enter, it just closes the search bar and doesn't navigate you to anywhere (currently it navigates me to all messages)</li>
<li>You can't "add filters" to recent conversations views, because they're not message narrows.</li>
<li>Searching <code>stream:foo</code> shows you the interleaved view for all messages in <code>#foo</code></li>
</ul>

<p>My perspectives on your bullet points:</p>
<ul>
<li>My suspicion would be that recent conversations has no initial search filters, since it was the alternative presentation of all messages, which also has no filters.</li>
<li>Having no pre-filled 'filters' when searching in a stream equivalent of recent conversations may be simpler for users in one way - just click and type - and this matches the current recent conversations view. However, right now that's inconsistent with how every other (messages) view pre-fills with the existing narrow filter. I feel the current recent conversations view gets an exception due to my first point.</li>
<li>I agree that hitting enter on an empty search going to a different place is confusing. Perhaps that could go to the default starting narrow (all messages vs recent conversations)? However, that may remove the possibility of a user accessing all messages via the search bar.</li>
<li>While recent conversations is not strictly a regular message list view/narrow, I view it as simply a different collapsed view of (all) messages. The recent conversations checkboxes and topic filter are akin to persistent friendly versions of our search filters. So adding search filters feels natural to me, and something to integrate.</li>
<li>Having <code>stream:foo</code> go to interleaved <code>#foo</code> is fine. How can I jump to a recent conversations view of <code>#foo</code>, without clicking on a stream when it's configured that way?</li>
</ul>

<p>In broadening the application of recent conversations, my sense is that we could go two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emphasize Search (and filters in that bar) as a distinct entity separate from recent conversations views. The title of stream recent conversations would be distinct from the search bar, using search leaves any recent conversations view and enters a traditional message list view, search filters don't affect recent conversations views, recent conversations filters do not affect initial search text</li>
<li>Integrate recent conversations more strongly with search, and acknowledge that recent conversations is an alternative message view. It could have a 'filter' representation as I improvised above, possibly represented by a visible toggle (or setting) - or multi-way to include Inbox view? Search filters and recent conversations filters would be made more interoperable where possible, switching between recent conversations and regular message list forms would pre-fill search with existing options by default, <code>stream:foo</code> would give an interleaved view or recent conversations view of <code>#foo</code> depending on the toggle value/setting</li>
</ul>

<p>I personally think search filters should work this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recent Conversations always has an empty search bar (no filters), both or org-wide and only stream-wide.</li>
<li>If the search bar is empty and you hit enter, it just closes the search bar and doesn't navigate you to anywhere (currently it navigates me to all messages)</li>
<li>You can't "add filters" (in search) to recent conversations views, because they're not message narrows. You can filter what topics you see with the checkboxes on the page.</li>
<li>Searching <code>stream:foo</code> shows you the interleaved view for all messages in <code>#foo</code></li>

<p>I personally feel okay with this because it seems odd to me to have an empty search navigate somewhere, and I think there will be more users accidentally doing empty searches than users who actively want to get to All Messages like that.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="21453">@Evy</span> I have not found it easily to totally parse the proposal here. But I had been thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>We could have <code>/#recent/stream/{id}</code> parallel to the <code>/#narrow/stream/{id}</code> URLs for "recent conversations for stream X"</li>
<li>I think some filtering, like "participated", might be nice to be able to do in "recent conversations for stream X", but in practice, anything other than "unread|muted" may be awkward to implement for data model reasons, so might be good to defer.</li>
<li>I think it's definitely simplest to keep the top-of-page search box independent of "recent conversations" for now. There's a world where we unify that in the future but it'll likely depend on a lot of data model refactoring that we definitely don't want to block on.</li>

<p>Reposting <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/26409#issuecomment-1687244999">my comment on the UI issues coming from the data challenges for this feature</a> for visibility:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So this view basically has a messy data problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>If we don't do a <code>participated</code> column, then we can use the existing <code>stream_topic_history</code> module to populate this view back to the beginning of time in the stream quite easily (that API query is a little slow the first time, but the web app caches data for a given stream for the duration of your session, so it should be fine). That data set doesn't have any participation data and it would likely not be cheap to adjust it to include such data.</li>
<li>With the "participated" column, what we can display is just recent conversations within the window that we display in the main "recent conversations" view ... which could be 0 conversations in the event that the stream doesn't have any recent messages. @alya's opinion was that was an unacceptable user experience to do that and have no way to fetch more.</li>
</ul>
<p>There might be an option to work around these problems by having the view merge the two data sets, and just have some "Participation data not available for older conversations" indication, either as a boundary or in the individual rows, that we design more thoughtfully than I have good ideas for right now.</p>
<p>But the other option is to figure out the scrolling system mechanics to just fetch more messages when you can see the bottom, and use a <code>MessageListData</code> object effectively for that stream narrow, with its associated <code>FetchStatus</code> object, to store the data. That plan likely involves some chipping away towards <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/23812">#23812</a>, which would be a very good thing to do, but is not going to be quick.</p>

<p>If folks have ideas for how we might indicate "we don't have participation data (yet)", that's going to be a situation we need to deal with the "inbox" view as well when the app first loads, if we're including a "participated" column there, so it might be worth figuring out some sort of reasonable UI pattern for conveying that situation without making things ugly.</p>
<p>With the contrast that in "inbox", we expect we will definitely have the data by 1-2 minutes after the app loads even if you've got like 50k unread messages, whereas for a stream narrow, we would not necessarily have a mechanism to ever populate older "participated" data.</p>

<p>I know I need to think about this a little more deeply, but my knee-jerk instinct is that participation is a more useful piece of information in the recent conversations view: let me check in on just the stuff I’ve been involved in, wherever in Zulip those conversations might be. By contrast, I would see the recent view for streams as basically a more readily browsable, information-rich version of what’s in the left sidebar (which also lacks any kind of participation data or filtering).</p>

<p>Oh sorry -- yes I meant removing it as the default view when clicking on a stream, not removing it from search views.</p>

<p>My thought was that replacing "clicking the stream name results in an interleaved view" with "clicking the stream name results in recent conversations with no participated checkbox" is an improvement, and we could add the participated information as followup work.</p>

<p>Yeah, that's the direction I have in mind as well.</p>
