<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="19257">@Alya Abbott</span> In our current create-stream interface, with the checkboxes, it's easy for an admin to add every eligible user in a realm to a stream with the "Check all" option.  Do we want to preserve that functionality in the input-pill paradigm that I am working toward?</p>

<p>For context, in the current UI, when you edit subscribers on the Subscribers tab, you can no longer add all users (but you can still copy users from existing streams).</p>

<p>I suppose we would also want a remove-all option for the case that you accidentally copied in a whole bunch of users from the wrong stream, but that feels like an unlikely scenario.</p>

<p>I am actually starting to think that the input pill can play nice with the checkbox UI with a few minor tweaks, which would make both of my above questions moot.</p>

<p>Hm, good question! I think once we move to the new groups model, it will be unnecessary, because it should be easy to add everyone (or all non-guests, etc.) with user groups. But I think for now we don't have a good alternative, and it <em>is</em> useful to be able to make a stream with everyone one it.</p>

<p>I am still thinking that remove-all is probably unnecessary:</p>
<ul>
<li>you can always cancel stream creation (which is only annoying if you entered a long description or something)</li>
<li>mistakes should be rare</li>
<li>it would add clutter</li>
<li>there's no easy way to undo remove-all</li>
</ul>

<p>One little quirk of our stream-edit UI is that we hide the email of the current user from themself if they're not an admin.  I assume this is somewhat unintentional, but there's an argument that it's reassuring to the user that even their own email is hidden.

<p>And that ties into a related point where we might be able to address both problems at once.  In the majority of stream-create use cases, it will be mandatory that you subscribe yourself to the stream, and you will always be subscribed by default until you hit the "Remove" button (assuming you even have that privilege).  So we put "you" at the top of the list to make that obvious.  Most people will recognize their own name, of course, but I think we can add a little of design detail here by showing something like "<strong>You</strong>: <a href="mailto:steve@example.com">steve@example.com</a>" in the email field.</p>

<p>Right now if you're using the keyboard and tab-enter to hit Add, then the button stays focused in a non-obvious way, and the user won't be able to do anything meaningful by hitting the button, since the pills will be cleared, or even more annoyingly, if the server is slow, they will send a redundant request when we're editing subscribers.  (The latter problem won't affect stream-create since everything is in memory until you actually hit the button to create the stream.)</p>
