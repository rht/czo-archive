<ul>
<li>the reduced color palette where white and grey are the primary colors </li>
<li>less use of “color bars as content dividers”. what I mean is today there’s a lot of use of colored bars to be used as dividers which becomes distracting. Eg “Discord &gt;&gt; Redesign to be like discord” has a background colored bar used as a divider. Replacing this with something more like the “—- yesterday—-today—-“ in Zulip as a divider of context discussions is less distracting &amp; more pleasing </li>
<li>simplified. Eg just in the chat input field, I see an icon for : smiley, text formatting, attachment, video. Eyeball, drafts. On Discord, only 1/2 of those options are present.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the <em>simplified</em> topic, another example is when I click REPLY, why does it displays the topic of “design &gt; redesign to be like discoed”. Why display that? If I click REPLY it should be assumed it’s to this topic. There appears from my, granted limited insight, lots of visual either content or artifacts that could just be removed from the current design. </p>
<p>Another example is why display at the top there’s 14k users. </p>
<p>Now I say this all with love for Zulip. I do firmly believe it solves for problems that other solutions do not. So please don’t take my comments as being negative. Just supportive.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="7">@Tim Abbott</span> <br>
Another thing that is good about Discord light theme:</p>
<ul>
<li>is the focus on the feed (being in white) and the de-emphasised focus on the far left and right columns (in grey)</li>
<li>the window padding is increased. Note: I'm note saying more overall padding, I'm simply saying that at the bottom/left/right of the window in Discord there is more padding making it easier to click the "Send" button so that it doesn't feel so cramped against the bottom of the browser window</li>
<li>on the topic of removing visual noise, if I've already selected the #design -&gt; "redesign to be like discord" Stream to be my focus, why in the feed area does it repeat saying that I'm in the "design -&gt;" stream. This seems like visual noise that can be removed</li>
</ul>

<p>That's a beautiful design. It's funny because everyone seems to be so focused on dark mode lately and they're not focusing on building good "light" themes and designs as much anymore. </p>
<p>Few things that stand out from a design perspective to me: </p>
<p>The bigger bolder fonts are definitely in. Notably Apple is pivoting towards bigger and bolder fonts as well with macOS Big Sur and iOS 14 <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur-preview/">https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur-preview/</a> I usually follow Apple when it comes to design trends like this, especially since so many people use Macs now, matching the UI/UX elements for the next version of mac/iOS helps keep the apps looking like they belong by following similar design principles.</p>
<p>I also like the rounded user icons, and the white space utilization is pretty good although maybe a little too much in some splaces. There's definitely some crowding in Zulip's design where a few extra pixels of padding could go along way.</p>
<p>Things I don't like about this design is there's too many different similar yet contrasting shades of grey. I definitely prefer Zulip's more effective utilization of just plain white.</p>
<p>If there is anything we could borrow from this from a design perspective, I'd say circular icons, bigger and bolder fonts, and increasing our padding / spacing (not much, just a few pixels in some cases).</p>

<p>Kind of boring if I'm going to be honest. It feels too much like e-mail which I don't like. I do like its modern look and feel, but yeah they over do the padding, and it has a Facebook or Asana look to it that I'm not a huge fan of. It isn't a bad design, just not the design decisions I would make personally.</p>

<ul>
<li>less use of color</li>
<li>simplified design (less elements on the screen)</li>
<li>slight increase in padding (but not much)</li>
<li>slight increase in font size (but not much)</li>
<li>no redundant info on the screen (like how we duplicate the title bar of the stream name)</li>
<li>a focus on the news feed (white news feed / grey sidebars)</li>

<p>Interleaved views are valuable in contexts that don't always match <a href="http://chat.zulip.org">chat.zulip.org</a>.  E.g. they're great when traffic is low and you want to leave Zulip open on a side monitor and be able to see new messages come in without having to click into the window at all.</p>

<p>So much this. Flowdock didn't have an interleaved view, but displayed one flow (stream) at a time. I so much wished for a firehose where I could keep an eye on what's happening globally without having to <code>esc + a</code> (equivalent of <code>N</code>) all the time.</p>

<p>But I get the redundancy argument...  So how about this:</p>
<p>Restyle the recipient bar to <code># stream &gt; topic</code>, with big bold colored <code>#</code> and <code>&gt;</code> (as in the navbar/Wyatts screenshot). This is default (All messages, search result).</p>
<p>When narrowed down to stream, change it to <code>&gt; topic</code> (still colored <code>&gt;</code>), and we have the <code># stream</code> in the navbar.</p>
<p>When narrowed to topic, lose the recipient bar (need to figure out what to do with the mute button), and put <code># stream &gt; topic</code> into the navbar.  Something similar can be done to PMs.</p>
<p>The links in the navbar should probably be changed, so one can click on <code># stream</code> when in topic narrow and go to stream narrow.</p>
<p>Good or bad idea?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="9808">@Yash ✨</span> Yeah, I know it would require some thinking about where to put those things (where message buttons are perhaps), but if we're moving stream into the navbar because of redundancy, it makes sense to move topic too. It makes sense that if you're looking at a thing (stream, topic, whatever), it's in the navbar.</p>
<p>If we managed to get the stream description in there, the length of topics shouldn't be a problem.</p>

<p>Reacting to the first screenshot: somehow, their layout seems a bit cluttered to me and dare I say, a tad juvenile. A couple of nice things though: the visible user search box (should be better aligned) and, more importantly, the compose box at the bottom which displays a couple of associated functions on the right. It would be nice to have something similar in Zulip, with the video icon showing up, so that you know you can create a video session in that place.</p>
<p>Another thing: their layout seems similar to Zulip's (users on the right, topics on the left etc.) even with a two-level classification of the topics. Am I right about this?</p>

<p>I got a question: Why was the stream name put in the navbar? Is there any argument for putting stream name there that doesn't apply to topic too?</p>
<p>We got some prime screen realestate up there, and I think that Wesleys point about current topic being more valuable information than stream description is valid. And I think that his point that one is more interested in the stream description in stream narrows is quite good too.</p>
<p>I know that it's a bit far fetched, but losing the  recipient bars in topic narrows would go a long way towards being "more like Discord".</p>

<p>I don't think "more like Discord" is actually the goal; the goal is to make the design nicer. </p>
<p>For context, the stream description (or something conceptually similar like "pinned messages") in that top navbar area was the second most requested feature in Zulip for a long time.  My feeling is that it's something that's important for administrators but less so to end users who aren't trying to get information out to subscribers.  I don't think we'll want to remove that, though we could of course consider other designs that fit the topic at the top (e.g. using 2 lines).</p>
<p>My thinking is we want the topic to stay in the recipient bar to preserve that as a consistent part of the experience (regardless of what type of view you're in, you just look up from the current message to the next recipient bar and you get the date and the thread).</p>

<p>So, even though there's a limit to how close we can get to discord because our model is different and having the recipient bar stick right near the end of the navbar is approximately as good as having it be a part of the navbar,  we <em>could</em> try out something where it directly attaches to the navbar....<br>
... but I don't think there's an immediate need for it. Kill FRB first.</p>
<p>I don't think we want to drop the stream description that's there, and replacing the stream name field with topic names would not make sense since topic names tend to be longer / more complex.</p>

<p>Having the description be always visible is beneficial for a great many reasons, including broad stuff like: consistency, ease for new users, a more descriptive theme for stream contents than just the stream name, as well as small stuff: links, markdown content etc</p>

<p>But I could make the same argument for stream name? As it is now, when I'm in all messages, I need to scan upwards, but for stream/topic narrows I should look in the navbar (if we remove it from the recipient bar there). In PMs, when I narrow to a person, it has that persons name in the navbar. I think it would be more consistent if the navbar reflected that I'm actually in a topic narrow, rather than being equivalent to a stream narrow.</p>
<p>And I think that if we assume that people understand why we remove stream names in stream narrow, it would make just as much sense to them if we removed topic in topic narrow..</p>

<p>I personally would like to keep the interleaved view, it's helpful to go through stuff when coming back after a period.<br>
I was thinking to work on improving the message UI along with the bit to remove stream name when narrowed on a stream if someone is not working already on it.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="16825">@AciD</span> I think you can take a look at any of Discord, Twist, and to a lesser extent Slack and compare those with Zulip - their design is much more modern and clean. </p>
<p>I'm not a designer, but for me (and the rest of my team), Zulip looks like something from 15 years ago. </p>
<p>Some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>drop the gravatars (or at least make them optional)</li>
<li>usernames in line with comments</li>
<li>drop most of the blocks and shading and outlines - just so much visual noise</li>
<li>bump up the font sizes</li>
<li>use full page width</li>

<p>Are you suggesting putting usernames to the left of comments? I don't think that's a good idea.</p>

<p>I think the Zulip interface is already quite minimal.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The fixed width by default is intentional to increase readability of longer texts. In the display settings you can enable full width display.</p>
<p>I agree about the gravatars looking dated. I think an easy change to make Zulip look more modern would be to increase the padding of the sidebar items.</p>

I am proposing a clean looking web UI which can be done by minimum changes in the current UI. </p>
<ol>
<li>No need to have background color for PM &amp; Mentions messages. The heading itself distinguishes it. Avoiding multiple color components. Only currently selected message should have the background color. </li>
<li>No need to have right side bar, as it is duplicated and available on left side also. So PMs and Users can be accessible from same space. New user can be also invited from here. You may keep the right side bar for bigger screens, but should show other important info of selected stream/user/group. I will try to share the right bar design also. </li>
<li>All Streams, PMs and topics should be arranged as per latest message on top. </li>
<li>No need to have a date divider in between messages as the date is always shows on top right corner and hardly identifiable in current UI. </li>
<li>No need to have a box for a message thread to unclutter the screen further. </li>
<li>Users can be invited and new stream can be created from '+' icon beside search icon. So removing links to give more space and cleanliness to left sidebar. </li>
<li>Adding three dot action menu next to search icon on top right for actions on stream same as it is available on left side bar.     </li>
<li>Other UI functionality like mouse hover, actions, message body etc remain as it is. </li>
<li>Stream heading on top remain same. But, to show PM with single user's heading as suggested in design. <br>
The proposed design is attached herewith.  <a href="/user_uploads/2/ce/Y_k4D-csYjVjuSGwhyCeJEzm/Zulip-Web-All-Messages-.pdf">Zulip-Web-All-Messages-.pdf</a> <br>

<p>Thanks, you make some good suggestions! I agree about:</p>
<ul>
<li>removing the background colors from PM &amp; mention messages</li>
<li>removing the right and bottom border of messages</li>
<li>using a + icon like Mattermost has it</li>
<li>adding an icon to indicate that you can click on the stream name</li>
<li>showing the user status in PM headers (I already opened the issue  <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/15686">#15686</a> for this a month ago)</li>
</ul>
<p>I disagree about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No need to have right side bar</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There already is the <em>Show user list on left sidebar in narrow windows</em> display setting. Afaik that option is currently disabled by default because of scrolling issues.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All Streams, PMs and topics should be arranged as per latest message on top. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>No then you cannot remember positions and always have to look around to find things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No need to have a date divider in between messages </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find the date dividers useful. Pretty much every messaging app has them, so I don't think we want to remove them.</p>

<p>It may be true when you have 20-30 streams, but will be difficult for user when they have 100-200 streams and less active streams are on top.  Pretty every messaging app is showing latest on top. I am sure for PMs/users and topics it make more sense to show date wise as they in lot in numbers and every time scrolling/searching is inconvenient.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There already is the Show user list on left sidebar in narrow windows display setting. Afaik that option is currently disabled by default because of scrolling issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, my proposal is to merge PMs list and User list and show it at one place. Why to show two lists when the purpose can be solved by one list. Showing on left or right side is not that important. This way we can unclutter the left bar in narrow screen.  <br>
A user would want to see the list as per his recent chat and reply to them. The status icon can be anyway shown on user image for that purpose.</p>

<p>I'm also interested in Zulip's design roadmap.  If we're comparing to other platforms, I'd be more interested in seeing more of Slack's UI (crisp + intuitive visual feeds, easy DMs) than Discord's.</p>
<p>Very interesting discussion, and I would love to hear more of the thoughts/ideas/possibilities to this end</p>

<p>Discord doesn't support threading (within a channel).  Thus its UI mechanics are pretty different from Zulip.  Also Discord is optimized for public gaming chat, not serious discussions at work.  So Discord's requirements are somewhat different.</p>
<p>Slack is a much better comparison.  Its architecture and use case are very similar to Zulip.</p>
<p>MS Teams is also very similar to Zulip, but personally I haven't seen "forum" style discussions happening much in Teams.  Perhaps it is because the UI does not provide good mechanisms for keeping track of many different threads.  Slack's UI really does that well.</p>

<p>Slack offers a selection of ready-made colour schemes to choose from, which is a nice feature, since users tend to like the ability to personalize their view. </p>
<p>Somewhat related (general UX): I occasionally access Zulip on my phone. I prefer the browser version, because it is full-featured. My only problem is that the buttons are a bit small for a touch screen. In my view, adapting their size to fit grubby fingers would render the need for a native app obsolete.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="15931">@Plankter</span> Thanks for the feedback.  In the early days of our mobile app, I tended to use the browser app for the same reason you do.  I now mostly use the native mobile app, but there are still times where I wish we had invested more in making the browser experience nicer on mobile.  We had a couple folks make some nice tweaks in 2020, and when anybody steps up to fix mobile web bugs or usability issues, we are usually pretty receptive to patches.</p>
<p>Most of the mobile web annoyances are about either controls being too small for the thumbs or other device-specific things, but there are some possible fixes that would benefit the desktop experience for people who like to tile windows.</p>
<p>So I hope somebody reading this gets inspired.</p>

<p>That’s awesome to hear. For me, what I like about the light theme from discord is:</p>
<ul>
<li>minimum color pallet</li>
<li>good typography (font, spacing, etc)</li>
<li>correct focus (the main window is the focus by only being white)</li>
<li>
<p>no hard dark colors. I’m older (41) and find dark mode or dark colors hard to parse. Which means a light sidebar. <br>
**** Removing all unneeded visual noise, I’ll give examples of Zulip visual noise</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why is each “#” in the side bar a different color</p>
</li>
<li>why have thr triple vertical dots everywhere in the sidebar</li>

I have to admit though, their previous design was really good - kind of surprised by this redesign nut nonetheless. Screenshots of old Twist design in higher up in this same thread.

<p>Hi Guys,<br>
Here's the story about our team and Zulip.<br>
It's been 2 years since I've deployed Zulip server for our organization.</p>
<p>We're receiving the CI/CD status logs, Source control changes, Jira workflow, sentry logs, Monitoring Alerts... We can follow each of which with the magical feature of Zulip: distinguishing the messages by the meaningful topics and the insane high speed search among whole archive of messages. No more slack messages, alert emails or SMS (I appreciate that, Really thanks for it guys!)</p>
<p>But like any other features in the IT world, It has its pros and cons. I believe that it's not ideal for our daily routine chats. It lacks of many UI/UX facilities, which makes it hard to use, not only for the normal users, but also for the technical team. I couldn't urge our teams to use it. They switched back to the WhatsApp cancer!</p>
<p>i.e. I wanna send a direct  message to someone.  Here's the scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>I should find them among the list of users. Most of the times I should click on the magnifier icon, which is small. and search for their names. Because they have no avatars. Or as the other option: I should go over the online users, if he/she is offline.</li>
</ul>
<p>or the scenario of writing a message in a stream:</p>
<ul>
<li>I gonna send them a message. So, I start typing. But, no! I should've clicked on the text box, earlier. I don't need keyboard shortcuts.</li>
<li>Oh, I should also set the topic.</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, separated topics for receiving loads of messages is ideal. but for the daily chats, having just the concept of stream is enough. (so, maybe we should have a concept of topic-less streams in Zulip in the feature? I don't know, but I failed to make the team to write their messages in the correct topic.) </p>
<p>After all, we decided to keep Zulip to receive the messages from our infrastructure. But for the chat purpose, we gonna use sth like <a href="http://Element.io">Element.io</a>. It has also additional features like sending voice messages.<br>
Sorry to say that and Also for my grammar. I hope that I could've give you the necessary feedback from our sides.</p>
<p>Cheers guys!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>(drilling down into just this) Zulip does have the option to allow stream messages without a topic. I think it's an org-level setting. The topic ends up being something like "(no topic)" which acts like a topic itself.</p>

<p>I'd like to echo what others have said in that having a refreshed design using principles that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="22406">@Xavier</span>  outlined (and looks more similar to Twist or Discord as screenshot discussed) in this thread would be a huge welcome.</p>
<p>I too struggle to gain company adoption of Zulip due to what people perceive as a "dated" or "old looking" design.</p>
<p>Twist is an interesting comparison since it's highly similar in concept to Zulip being subject based. Though I too preferred their previous design more than their current but I'd say both of their designs are better than Zulip.</p>
<p>No intended disrespect. Just hoping 2022 is the year of design refresh.</p>

<p>I just have to chime in with almost totally opposite opinions. There are some elements in Zulip UI I could  want to change, but very little. The call for "modern" layouts like what Xavier asks for.... No thanks. <br>
I like the compact layout with little wasted real estate. To me, I like a small font with compact layout so that as much content is available on screen at a time. I would want to be able to make it even vore compact: Be able to hide the profile pictures and reclaim the wasted space below them. I just need messages to be prefixed by nick/name. Similar to Slack "Compact" theme. I shall post an example.<br>
What others call "visual noise", I consider "having info and functionality available immediately onscreen. Most of the points Xavier points out, are things I like. But I am an old geek. IRC user from early 90s up until the 2010s. Then we used Slack at my company for a few years. We old schoolers just ran it compact. Then we moved to Zulip and never looked back. (I have also used Discord a little. ) There may be colleagues (30 total) who think similarly to Xavier et al, but they are few and don't voice their opinion.<br>
So I understand that people may think differently, maybe folks who grew up with Discord and Slack, and maybe with iOS or Android as their primary computing device. These are matters of taste and habit. Therefore, I hope Zulip do not make radical changes until they have a theme-based setup that let's us choose. Remember that there are surely quite a few of us who think that the different design of Zulip is one of the aspects that make it <em>better</em> than Discord and the likes of it. If you prefer Discord - use Discord.... :P<br>
But if you give us choice, that is nice:</p>
<ul>
<li>choice of layouts. "Old school", "Discord like" (or what you want to call it), more. I.e. "layoyt" means (typo)graphical.</li>
<li>choice of amount of info on screen in terms of more or less. Do you want old-school like a F16 HUD or minimalistic?</li>
<li>choice of hiding panes. Like hiding user list.</li>
<li>choice of color palettes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, I must commend the Mobile app. It is awesome. I don't use it as my #1 chat tool, that I do on the desktop (although I can start and participate in the mobile app as well). The app is mainly to get a glimpse, status, maybe enter into some chat to scroll through it and then not having to do that at the office.<br>
Now, I am a Manager. Project Manager and more. So I am just the type of user who looks at Zulip often in batches. Which is awsome. Are you (maybe like Mehdi's team?) just team members who are online continously, you don't need this. I still recommend <a href="http://zulip.com/why-zulip">zulip.com/why-zulip</a>, and way back that piece hit me real hard.</p>

<p>Yeah, to me and most of my co-users these changes would be in the wrong direction. Down to almost each and every point on Xavier's list. I like having functionality in the main HUD. I think the pre-filled search box helps to show how to use the search syntax (which is powerful). I like the dense layout.  Almost everything that differs from Discord or Slack is for the better - in my opinion. And I presume there are others who agree on this: As Zulip has indeed become what it is, it must be because someone liked it like this. <br>
But this is a matter of taste and habit. So I just hope as I said that it comes with choice. </p>
<ul>
<li>Airy ("light") or dense ("classic") layout.</li>
<li>Lots of buttons and functional elements ("classic"), or little ("light")</li>
<li>various predefined and custom color palettes. Including the current.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="22331">@Gaute Lund</span> I didn't take what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="22406">@Xavier</span> was describing as removing functionality or having a less dense layout. I took it as he'd like to keep the same dense information layout but simply remove elements that are distracting and/or infrequently used ... and for those infrequent elements - make them discoverable instead of shown by default (e.g. hidden by default but shown on hover).<br>
I for one am 100% aligned with that concept and direction for a reduced information design (note: I'm not saying "new design" just a more minimal yet still information dense design).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="22421">@Bethany Davis</span> I think I did understand what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="22406">@Xavier</span>  wants. He described it quite well. I am just saying that <em>I don't want that.</em> All the requests are things that I can very well understand that are desirable to some, if people have a different background or for some other reason preferences that are different than mine. Such design/usability choices will inevitably be highly subjective. That's why I try to not argue against those preferences, I try to make it clear that I am in a different camp, and I rather stress that I hope they get implemented as options.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="22433">@Vlad Korobov</span> A mockup may be interesting. But rather for the others who want something different. Question #1 would be if you would plan to have the kind of design choices requested here, implemented as options, so that in each of said three areas (layout/(typo)graphical, visible info/queues/functions, and color palette) one can choose. <br>
To me, the mockup can be whatever, as long as options will exist as to not use it.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="22331">@Gaute Lund</span> sure, mockup is not an obligation :) its just an easier form of iteration on ideas. I'm also personally might be in different camps on different features. For example all the <strong>why</strong> points for me are just questions which could be answered or could be used to improve.<br>
I think <code>why</code> questions are never bad, and it probably important in such community driven project to have answers somewhere documented.<br>
I jus think that this discussion has a history but its very hard for me to accumulate everything in my mind and if participants willing to see how it could be I would do an attempt.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="22433">@Vlad Korobov</span> I'm no photoshop expert, but a design moving more towards the direction of the mockup linked below is what I'd like to see. A few things to note: </p>
<ul>
<li>same info density</li>
<li>reduced color palette</li>
<li>reduced visual noise of infrequent tasks or info (removal of sub count, text in search bar, icons)</li>
<li>higher contrast between the "feed"  and the side panel <br>
I'm certainly not suggesting this mockup is perfect, but moving towards the principles mentioned above would be hugely beneficial IMO.<br>

<p>My thought is that if someone what's to see the People panel, they could be listed under the Gear icon menu. E.g. "Show People Panel" or "Hide People Panel" from the gear icon menu.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>same info density</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I beg to differ yet again. The elements you remove in the mockup are info to me, like people panel with statuses, stream info in top bar and much more. <br>
Like I don't need to have the top bar void, just dead space, when I actually do not search. The dual functionality today of the top bar showing info, and then when you click search, the bar is used to type the actual search - that is just perfect. To me. Hence, the info density is by definition less for me and anyone who prefer to have that information present. Of course it is different for someone who considers it "noise" or "clutter".<br>
As said, this is extremely subjective. E.g. I don't see a point in having a color difference between the panes, but it doesn't bother me either - as long as there is still a dark mode palette (as an <em>option</em>). I run as many apps as possible dark, I find the old-school white screens tiresome. But that is just me. (And, <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/423717/dark-mode-isn%E2%80%99t-better-for-you-but-we-love-it-anyway/">a lot of others.</a>)<br>
I could elaborate on <em>why</em> I think what I think, but that shouldn't be necessary. Just the fact that a) my preferences go in the opposite direction on almost every point, and b) some people obviously agree with me since it was designed this way in the first place - that should be enough.<br>
So pretty please, sugar on top, let all of these design  changes be options. Including the removal of useful info and functionality in the main window.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="22331">@Gaute Lund</span>  I didn’t take it as Bethany was “removing” the people panel. I took it that she herself doesn’t have the people panel enabled and what she did, which was very productive to the conversation btw and I haven’t seen anyone else do,  is she mocked up how she’d change her own screen settings. It was meant to be a conversation starter. And it was also stated in her post that the people panel could be re-enabled via the menu as a suggestion. <br>

<p>Yeah, if my writing came across as disdainful in any way, I apologize. I don't see anything that could be called "hate". I am just trying to bring my opinion. I  definitely can understand that some people like the design ideas that have been proposed. As said, these preferences will be subjective. <br>
The mockup here is without a people panel, so I pointed out I like having it showing, and the mockup removes other elements  like the info in the top bar. Bethany did describe people panel on/off" as an option - good. But other elements: Removing info and leaving empty space will by definition reduce info density, to someone who would rather have that info (or functionality) present. To someone who thinks these elements were noise/clutter, info density will obviously increase. Again, subjective.<br>
All I am saying is that over all the suggestions and mockups that have been shown, I actually prefer everything the way it is. And my preferences as such are quite consistent throughout this thread. Therefore I repeat that I hope these changes can be implemented as options so we all can be happy,  which to my rather community-oriented and collectivist mind should be the main goal. My <a href="#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/Redesign.20to.20be.20like.20Discord/near/1294520">first post in the thread</a> said the the same, including "I understand that people may think differently". And hoping for options.<br>
So again, sorry if I came across as a grumpy old genXer. It may very well be because I <em>am</em> a grumpy old genXer.</p>

<p>"Hoping" it is, because some here in the thread speak about major change, not calling it options, so I sort of take that role of asking repeatedly for everything to be implemented as options.<br>
And "hoping" it is, because I understand that for Zulip (the team and Kandra) creating options for everything may add too much labor, complexity and maintenance. When you redesign a UI you may just want to leave the old and move in a new direction. And maybe strike a balance, with <em>some</em> options. Just like with WinXP - Win7 - Win8 - Win10, I have friends/colleagues who want to, with each major change, to set settings to make their UI be "more like before" and maybe use 3rd party addons to get it even more so.<br>
It should be quite feasible to implement everything some people have asked for, as options <a href="#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/Redesign.20to.20be.20like.20Discord/near/1299929">in various categories</a>. If Zulip team decides that "no, we will leave the old UI for something completely new, creating options for everything is too much, it is not a part of the underlying UI architecture" - well, I will be sad, but I will live.</p>

<p>By the way I made a design change ignoring my personal desire... which very easy to achieve without any development. I always zoom in Zulip in browser 110%. And if people are not against it, I could do another round and make a zoomed version of the design where some things are a bit bigger.</p>

<p>I wanted to reduce fast moving stripes across the whole screen when I scroll but keep the easy distinguishment by an eye of different topics. So if we make a grey bar full width we aren't gaining much but if we minimize it to the size of the topic its easier to see the difference between topic just by catching that the width of the bar changes.</p>

<p>I think it's useful to have those fast moving stripes when you're in a #stream view, because you're supposed to notice different topics moving by... And you won't see them in a #stream&gt;topic view because there's only one topic.<br>
I do think it would be a good idea to reduce the intensity of the grey (which your design also does).</p>
<p>But maybe that's just me, so I'd like to hear what other folks think.</p>

<p>This is awesome Vlad! Very good overall direction—much cleaner and more modern while still being Zulip.</p>
<p>To address some of the questions you brought up in the video:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our main scrollbar is on the browser’s right so that users with large screens have the entire browser window as a target area where they can use the scroll wheel or touchpad scroll gestures. Visually moving the scrollbar without breaking this would require some kind of kludge that listens for scroll events and manually translates them in code to scrolling movement; such emulation inevitably results in laggy awkward behavior that feels much worse than the platform’s native scrolling.</li>
<li>The Zulip logo in the top-left corner is customizable, and we expect organizations to replace it with their own logo, but it would be reasonable to streamline the default logo we use there.</li>
<li>The multiple new-message buttons are an effort to nudge new users toward keeping the discussion organized. There’s a concern, for example, that if starting a new topic were to take more clicks or be less discoverable than replying to an existing topic, it would become much more common for new users to randomly append new discussions to unrelated topics. There’s room for different ideas here; we’d need to do user testing to be sure.</li>
</ul>

<p>The interaction of the colored stream bar with the rounded focus rectangle at the bottom left corner looks a little broken. That’s probably easy to address by moving the focus rectangle to the right enough to not overlap (though maybe that would create the appearance of an extra-thick line when the stream bar is also blue).</p>

I really enjoyed the video from <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="22433">@Vlad Korobov</span>, and it was pretty striking to me that when he flips between Zulip, Slack, and Discord, it's very clear that the designers were making the same types of tradeoffs, but with different constraints.  For example, as Vlad mentioned, Discord wants to be "fun", so they gladly sacrifice information density for visual flair.  Slack wants to be simple, so they sacrifice some convenience in the name of cleanness.  And Zulip has its own constraints.  I'm not saying designers have gotten it completely right on any of the products, but I do think folks have a tendency for complaining that the orange doesn't taste like an apple.</p>

<p>On a very minor note, I'm +1 on removing the keyboard icon.  It's very easy to tune out, so I don't have any passionate objections to it, but I believe it's kinda silly for it to remain forever on your screen if either a) you have no interest in keyboard shortcuts or b) you use keyboard shortcuts and learn the meta "?" hotkey.  I would try to treat keyboard shortcuts as an on-boarding problem.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="699">@Anders Kaseorg</span> thank you for clarification about the scrolling. I still not why would it be bad to have a native scroll bar of the middle column stick to the left side of the right column. I guess don’t fix what's broken and it's better to leave it like this.</p>
<p>About the bottom left corner at the end of the topic. It's intentionally like this. If the focus ring would be in the middle of the topic you don’t see such a problem. So the fix could be to make the left bar of a topic go a bit lower. I guess here I should show different variations.</p>
<p>I made the “redesign” with artificial constraints. That is usually not how products do that. I didn’t talk to stakeholders, didn’t interview the users, or review any usage stats. Maybe there is no need in the color coding of streams, maybe the bigger problems are in onboarding, maybe the biggest feature to design is Recent topics… I don’t know a lot of things to actually improve design significantly.</p>

<p>Basically the middle container takes the whole free available space but the actual content is a div inside that, we make the parent middle container which is always 100% width scrollable vertically. Anyway my point is that I’m not against the current implementation and see benefits of it</p>

<p>What I’m saying is that the principle that the scrollbar is attached to the side of the scroll target is fundamental to the way browsers work. You can either have a scrollbar next to the middle column and have only the middle column as the scroll target, or you can have the scrollbar at the side of the page and have the whole page as the scroll target. This isn’t something you can get around with padding and margin tricks.</p>

<p>Your proposal where the actual content is in a smaller div inside a full-width scrolling container is exactly what we do now—and this is why the scrollbar is on the side of the page.</p>

<p>My only suggestion would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>remove the colored status indicators in the people panel. I’ve always thought just having 3 section (active, idle, offline) made more sense that showing a dozen “green circles”  </li>
<li>why is Alya post in your screenshot have a blue border. If it’s a comment directed at you, I’d suggest no outline but instead make the message background color standout (eg yellow background, no colored border )</li>
<li>I’m iffy on the colored hash “#” in the left panel. I’d be curious to see what it’d look like for all the “#” to be grey and only the active thread a different color. Or maybe instead, just remove the “#” all together. Is the hash even needed at all?</li>

My personal preference in addition to what Chad said is that I’ve always loved the Proxima font. It’s highly readable for super dense layouts and also adds a bit of polish to an overall UI design. There is an extremely similar free open font created by VMWare that I’d love to see adopted in your redesign. <a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity-city">https://github.com/vmware/clarity-city</a></p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="22433">@Vlad Korobov</span> These look GREAT. My favorite so far is ui-proto-suggest.png version (the original version). Though what I might suggest is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>removal of the filter and triple-dot icons as mention above (show on hover)</li>
<li>on the main feed, maybe make the yellow background (behind design) a lot lighter yellow (not so bold of a yellow color)</li>
<li>I like the suggestion of the removal of the colored "#" in the left panel (maybe only keep color for the active Stream)</li>
<li>I liked the suggestion of removing the color circles in the people panel (green, etc) and instead - just section off a list of "Online", "Idle", Offline" - that way it also eliminates the color in the people panel</li>

For context, I consider myself a long time Zulip user, so I've seen some UI elements come and go, though I've been distracted by working on the terminal front-end at times.</p>
<p>Of your variations so far, similar to others I definitely prefer the first version you posted.

<p>Some things have been discussed/adjusted recently, so I think those would need to be considered in the context of the existing associated discussions, such as for the compose buttons at the base - though having a single 'compose' is always going to be nice if it was feasible.</p>
<p>Other areas haven't been discussed as much (that I'm aware of), and two that I think could be prioritized and worked on independently are:</p>

<li>Move the gear icon and remove the extra keyboard shortcut menu <span aria-label="+1" class="emoji emoji-1f44d" role="img" title="+1">:+1:</span> While having a full left-column-width logo is great for simplicity, having the gear/cog for user settings in the top-left is more focused, and keeps it separate from the user list, which is definitely cleaner. Conceptually "my" settings being near my user makes sense at some level, but there's a lot more in the menu than that (not least of which organization settings). </li>
<li>Use subtle darker/lighter shading for the columns and skip those gridlines <span aria-label="+1" class="emoji emoji-1f44d" role="img" title="+1">:+1:</span></li>
</ol>
<p>I think those two could be impactful alone and are less controversial than others that have been raised in this topic!</p>

<p>Personally I enjoy the roughly monochrome styles and using color for highlights - which seems to be the current Zulip approach. In that sense I wouldn't like to see the stream colors disappear, or user-activity colors (green dot, orange half-circle). However, I could understand that being part of a "high contrast" (if slightly colored) styling. Of course, I'm a longer-term Zulip user/developer, so I have that bias.</p>

<p>btw, I like the idea of having a "reset" button in the color picker that sets the color to a default grey. I like the idea that muting a stream will also make its color become that same grey.<br>
I also kinda like the idea of changing the muted stream from # or padlock (or globe) to be a volume mute but that might be a bit more decisive.</p>
<p>The neat result of making at least some change here is that it makes a difference between "inactive stream" and "muted inactive stream"</p>

<p>I'd love for the no-color (expect for main feed attention on things like @ messaging people) design to be a default theme. It's way less distracting, way easier for my eyes to parse quickly and way more focused - which is what I like so much. Essentially, color is only used to attract you attention on the rare occasion your attention needs to be grabbed.</p>

<ul>
<li>color-less as an option? - No opinion, except some worry over the challenge of maintenance.</li>
<li>bigger font? - No opinion, would be fine either way to me.</li>
<li>wider font? - No opinion, would be fine either way to me.</li>
<li>how important is vertical color line - Not important in a specific stream / topic, but I think it might be useful in the all messages view.</li>
<li>what's up with unread message indicator? how important is that? why on the left side? how visible/subtle it should be? - I think the current visibility is better than that in the proposed design, but I may be biased because I'm used to it. I think they're important to always be visible.</li>
<li>would it be ok to show message buttons on hover in a tooltip style - I like the proposal in theory, but I wonder if it would actually be better in practice. (where you put the mouse might hide a word or so from the previous message, keyboard accessibility?)</li>

<p>Hey, sorry to be slow to jump into this one! I spent yesterday going through some threads that are a little less involved. :) I really appreciate the work from Vlad driving the discussion, and the thoughts/feedback everyone has been sharing! I think there are a lot of good ideas. To avoid writing one giant essay, I'll post a few messages with my thoughts on different aspects of the design. </p>
<p>In general, I like the overall visual direction --  it looks a lot cleaner!</p>
<h2>Top area</h2>
<p>I really like the rearrangement of the top area, which gets rid of the dead space above the user list. I had been imagining that we'd put the search box above the user list when we split it off from the stream description (<a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/20163">#20163</a>), but I think this is a better approach.</p>
<p>We can discuss (perhaps in a separate thread) whether it's important to have the stream user count and description at the top. I think we could plausibly remove it with a combination of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Showing the info in a tooltip when hovering over the name of the stream in the top bar.</li>
<li>Making the info easier to find in the menus (e.g. at the moment, subscriber count is shown in the left panel but not the right panel).</li>
<li>Implementing pinned topics (<a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19483">#19483</a>), which will be a good way to share important links and other info.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Right sidebar</h2>
<p>I personally find the right sidebar distracting and not super useful in a large org like CZO, and I'm looking forward to the option to hide it (<a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19927">#19927</a>). (Though perhaps it'll be more useful with the work <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="9808">Yash RE</span> is doing in <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/20072">#20072</a>.  :)) Even so, I don't think the fully monochromatic look is great (at least as a default option), though we could play with more muted colors, especially for the orange. We should keep in mind that:</p>
<ol>
<li>In a smaller org (and on CZO after <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/20072">#20072</a>), the orange helps distinguish from offline users. Currently on CZO, those users are always off-screen.</li>
<li>It's nice to have consistency between the right sidebar colors and left sidebar colors for PMs, where the green vs. orange vs. grey is already helpful.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a note, we've had some discussion about optionally showing profile pics in the right sidebar (<a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19999">#19999</a>), as a user option. So it would be good for the same status indicator colors to work well superimposed on a profile pic as well.</p>

<p>redesigns without bigger contexts are not even half done :) Also poll isn't representing all of the Zulip users.<br>
Lets give an opportunity for <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="19257">@Alya Abbott</span>  to provide a bigger context which will lead towards a better UI improvement</p>

<h2>Left sidebar</h2>
<p>I like the overall direction of using the grey background! A few specific notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>I don't have a clear idea on how to manage the unread counts so that they are readable and look good with the grey background; we may need to play with a few options on CZO. I feel like the current UI where they are very distinct helps with identifying which streams to read, but it may be fine to have it be more subtle.</li>
<li>For PMs, I'm hoping it'll work well to put them into a separate section, as described in <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19447">#19447</a>. That way it'll take fewer clicks to get to them, and it should be more discoverable for new users.</li>
<li>For managing muted streams, we have a rough plan to break the left sidebar into sections, as described in <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19812">#19812</a>. That may affect how folks feel about the icons.</li>
<li>It seems like the stream colors are moderately helpful to folks. We also have an idea about letting org admins set default stream colors (<a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/17968">#17968</a>), which will potentially make them even more useful.</li>
<li>I think reducing the margin to the right of the unread counts looks good (see screenshot <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="9808">Yash RE</span> posted above); we'd need to play with how it feels when the unread count moves on hover to make room for the three-dot menu. (Or perhaps the menu could show up to the left of the unreads?).</li>
</ol>

<p>menu on the left of another non clickable isn't good. we have such gap because of potential native scrolling. We could customize it/ stylize it so it wouldn't be wide and unpredictable... <a href="/user_uploads/2/43/CsrqvuSzXsaDmFJoeFt0sWNQ/image.png">image.png</a></p>

<h2>Message view</h2>
<p>I don't have as much that's concrete to say on this one. I'd be open to playing with removing the vertical stream-colored bars on the left, and making the unread line on the left more thin and subtle.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what's best for the stream/topic bars. We could play with removing the stream name, but I think even as it is users sometimes find it confusing what stream they are looking at and/or composing to. If we go that route, we may need to make the stream name in the top bar stand out more.</p>
<p>For the compose box, Zulip has a long history of new users finding it hard to figure out how to send a message. We only stopped hearing that after the change (made in 2021) that introduced the long "Message stream &gt; topic" button. So while I think the current three-button setup is far from perfect, I think it'll be a whole mini-project to figure out how to improve it without re-introducing confusion for new users. And of course, as I think Vlad mentioned, having a single compose button requires other changes to the compose experience. (I would love to see "Convert replies between stream and private messages  <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/3409">#3409</a>" regardless.)</p>

<h2>Removing and hiding buttons</h2>
<ol>
<li>It's probably fine to hide the "Subscribe to more streams" link in the bottom left; we can to some user testing to make sure folks can find the "+" next to Streams.</li>
<li>If we remove the "Invite more users" link in the bottom right, I wonder if we should add a "+" button next to the "Users" heading to parallel the streams? Not sure.</li>
<li>Making the filter/plus/search buttons hidden except on hover seems like another good candidate for user testing.</li>
<li>I've always felt that the keyboard button looks untethered/out of place. I understand that we want to make it easy to figure out that Zulip has awesome keyboard shortcuts, but it would be great to explore alternatives for how to do that. (E.g. the contextual shortcuts in the three-dot message menu seem like a nice approach.)</li>

<p>I feel like this topic has gotten so broad that it's hard to follow.  I think it's important to think broadly and holistically, but there's also a place to be concrete about certain things, so I hope we can (if we already haven't) split out some more specific topics here.</p>

<p>Yeah I think there are a lot of nice ideas in these layouts, particularly:</p>
<p><strong>Increasing type size</strong> - going from 14px to something like 16px is a big help for readability. Source Sans has a small profile and appears more like 13px as-is. The increase has the added effect in reducing line length from around 130 characters to 110 (75 considered to be a maximum for good readability). This seems like a change that could be made independent of new Discord styling.</p>
<p><strong>Removing counter on hover</strong> - love that it focuses on the interaction and removes the need for a blank ellipsis column.</p>
<p><strong>Card system</strong> - good use of the background color to break up the sections, and card header provides a natural way to store controls for the card.</p>

<p>Adding violet as an interaction color I think is increasing visual complexity, and is fighting a bit against the stream color system. i.e. if we have a stream that is violet color. So keeping interaction colors more agnostic like bold body text or gray, or more standard like blue makes sense to me. Though I agree interaction needs more thought.</p>

<p>Adding a row hover makes a lot of sense. And has using a stream color as a row selection been considered?

<ul>
<li>I like the idea of highlighed line for list of topics and don't mind to colorize it. <a href="/user_uploads/2/92/qMeddcnwS50VffcdGWwUKC4T/image.png">image.png</a> <div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/92/qMeddcnwS50VffcdGWwUKC4T/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/92/qMeddcnwS50VffcdGWwUKC4T/image.png"></a></div></li>
<li>I do prefer some color coding for user statuses and if somebody don't like to stare at such list of users it should be easily switchable. There were a thought that general list of users might be not optimal and should be stream related. Anyway I think that grayscale status is decreasing my speed of decoding</li>
<li>I don't find colored rectangle on the left top corner working better than the arrow. Arrow pointer is softer and allows to put other things inside that title section of a card if we need in future. <a href="/user_uploads/2/da/rCLP5DNbca6XnsGNY_4T7dAg/image.png">image.png</a>. But colored corner is less noisy and we might need to test both approaches on a scrolling experiment <div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/da/rCLP5DNbca6XnsGNY_4T7dAg/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/da/rCLP5DNbca6XnsGNY_4T7dAg/image.png"></a></div></li>
<li>I agree that  "Adding violet as an interaction color I think is increasing visual complexity", that was an experiment with brand encoding inside the product. But I like how grey-scaled version of counters makes the whole screen a bit lighter. </li>
<li>I think "stream color as a row selection been considered" would add confusion. Interactions should be consistent. And I think it works better when color is used for encoding like now: message where a user was mentioned, different kinds of mentions and any other cases we might have.</li>

<p>I don't remember exactly what was mentioned in the video (but you can check if you want), but it's something like a "focused" message state, so if you hover over a message it's color would change and you'd see the options we normally show (reactions, menu stuff), or if you've keyboard navigated onto a message then it would be in that same state.</p>

<strong>Changes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>grey background instead of current white</li>
<li>increased font from 14px to 15px, and the line-height from 17px to 19px (this could be just new default without any options to go back since the browser's <code>Ctrl-</code> should work fine)</li>
<li>dimmed counters on streams and topics list</li>
<li>search button is bigger (imitating a field instead of just an icon)</li>
<li>hover over the message highlights the whole message</li>
<li>unread message marker is on the right (I think this change is already in progress)</li>
<li>topic title inside messages is lighter</li>
<li>no vertical color line associated with the topic since its easier to distinguish topic conversation right now due to the white cards design</li>
<li>next to the gear icon in the top right corner we have the keyboard icon (we can skip putting the help icon there for now)</li>
<li>button to turn the right panel on or off (I think this change is already in progress)</li>
<li>some minor compose box icons and buttons reorganization</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn't show separation of the users into 2 groups, which is possible and will be addressed in a separate topic.</p>
<p>I think such change could be isolated from any other styles change, so any other screens, popups and tooltips could stay as they currently are until the redesign. <br>
Let me know what do you think and if we should start implementing that.</p>
<p><strong>Sorry if some of design desires isn't addressed.</strong> I'm  trying to come up with something which wouldn't decrease some readability and don't put extra work on this particular design implementation.</p>

<p>I think there was some version like this in the past, which I made to just have that variation. Thank you for doing another round at that. <br>
I understand that some people prefer extreme colorless versions. I don't think that is a shared desire by majority and I don't know if Zulip contributors would want to invest in such "no color" option.</p>
<p>If we don't use colored hashtags, I don't see the reason to use colored line and there is no reason to use colored arrow in this case too. It is ascetic and that is why it's boring (because ascetic should be boring <span aria-label="stuck out tongue wink" class="emoji emoji-1f61c" role="img" title="stuck out tongue wink">:stuck_out_tongue_wink:</span>)</p>
<p>In reality there are more statuses of users than 3 and not having a color is a bit confusing here. Like what is full circle vs hallow circle? Takes some time to decode and visually you need to do more work to separate one type of users from another, color really helps with that. It might be that in this version idle circle should be the way it is right now in Zulip.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="22433">@Vlad Korobov</span> this isn't perfect but linked below is a new mockup hopefully more toward the direction you were trying to guide me towards? Also, since I don't have the font - I was trying to denote in the left pane that bold text means an unread message (removing the need for the unread # count). But since I don't have the font, I just copy/pasted the "design" stream name a few times to use as an example placeholder. Hope that makes sense.</p>

<p>If I can sway anyone though back to my previous monochrome mockup from earlier today, I will say it's much closer to how Slack does the All Messages Unread main as well as left pane. Which is extremely easy to parse without color, at least for me.  They, they use the darkness/lightness of the stream name to convey activity (which allows for lack of color). </p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="22421">@Bethany Davis</span> as you can see the color of hashtag icon isn't that big of a deal. In my version I just use icons of exactly the color that I have now in Zulip... Yes in future such color defaults might be tuned towards better colors.</p>
<p>The users' group separation is already used... well, soon be used to split users to 'Subscribers" of a particular channel and "All other members" of the org, they also will be collapsible/expandable</p>
<p>I think there should be a single bold stream/topic if you want to avoid using background color. And I'm afraid we don't want to remove unread counts, even if I personally would love to don't show them by default on muted streams/topics. By the way Slack doesn't have counters for channels, I guess they realized that it doesn't matter the number. Anyway such thing could be achieved in future by having a counter circle without a number. Notice how Slack is using color to show the user status in the left column (Zulip can show users in the left column too)</p>

<p>I watched their videos. A good proof that tinted background color can live with colored hashtags. It looks like they are building a better collaborative emails and less of a chat.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="15931">@Plankter</span> as someone in favor of two background colors (white main / light sidebar) - I have to admit that the color used by Twist (which is largely just a white background) seems to work way better for it's design than Zulip. If Twist radically reduced the spacing/white-space ... no offense but I feel like the old Twist design would be an huge strong contender.</p>

<p>That seems very pragmatic to me.  I use light mode, and from an aesthetic perspective, I would like the sidebars to have a nice non-white background color chosen by a designer.  And then, if for some reason, I don’t like the background color, just let me customize it.</p>

<p>It's possible that we should split out a topic that is specifically related to color scheme, but I will stay here and give my perspective.  (For those of you that don't know me, I'm not a designer, but I'm one of the original Zulip developers, and I've used the product since 2014, so I have seen many design evolutions as well as a ton of customer feedback.  I also don't have any kind of color vision deficiency.)</p>

<p>For me the primary benefit of color in the Zulip UI is that I occasionally internalize stream colors, so that when I see a message in color X, it triggers me that it's probably on stream Y, and it saves my brain 500ms or whatever to have to actually read the stream name.</p>

<p>My current perspective is that our main priority should be to develop a small number of themes (e.g. light and dark, as now) that we are very happy with. I'm open to somewhat increasing the amount of possible customization in the process, e.g. to ease the transition for existing users, or when the technical burden of adding and maintaining the additional options is small. But adding extensive customization is probably not a good use of the limited design and front-end engineering resources we can dedicate to the redesign project. I would also be mindful of the maintenance burden of testing all future design and feature changes in a larger number of contexts.</p>
<p>Anyhow, those are my current thoughts -- as always, happy to change my mind if there are convincing arguments to the contrary. :)</p>

<p>For stream colors, to the extent that we want a more opinionated color scheme, we already have a pretty non-obtrusive but somewhat discoverable mechanism for users to customize them.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="19257">@Alya Abbott</span> but if you allowed users to modify say 6 of the primary colors - then you don't have to "create themes" and instead, allow your own users to do that.

<p>Sure, but we still need to offer some excellent defaults. I would guess that the <em>vast</em> majority of Slack users sticks with the default theme (light or dark version). So while we could offer such customization at some point, I would not consider it a big priority right now.</p>

<p>The points about customization basically come down to the idea that any basic structure has the back door that users can always override them.

<p>I don't think anybody has suggested that we actually <strong>build</strong> the customization features before the design overhaul.  The discussion here is more about whether it's in our long term strategy to allow users to customize colors.  That can influence design decisions.</p>
<p>If we frame the question (quoting Tim from above) as "Do we think it makes sense to allow color customizations?", then my resounding answer would be yes.  But the fact that it's still an open question makes me kinda worried.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I was thinking that it wouldn't really influence the design decisions right now, which is why I was urging that we set customization discussion aside for the present. If there are any decisions being made that are potentially in conflict with our ability to offer customization in the future, it would certainly be helpful to call that out and discuss the tradeoffs in the context of those specific decisions.</p>

<p>The most obvious thing is to just make our default color scheme simple, which I don’t think is controversial.</p>

<p>I’m concerned that removing stream colors will make the all messages view much more difficult to scan quickly. I recognize that I might be unusual in the importance I place on the all messages view, but I don’t think I’m alone.</p>
<p>If you want all your streams to be the same color, nothing stops you from configuring them all to be the same color. (Maybe we could provide bulk recoloring tools to make that easier.)</p>

<p>For me, the all messages view is a good way to follow multiple conversations in the background without interrupting my work. I don’t need to switch to the Zulip window, navigate to multiple topics, and decide in series whether I want to read each one. I can just glance at the window and occasionally two-finger scroll to the bottom without focusing it. No other chat app lets me do that, which makes them inherently more distracting. And the colors are extremely helpful as a quick visual cue for things that might be more likely to need my attention.</p>

<p>That's interesting to see, but does it show anything equivalent to Zulip topics in those views? Otherwise there's definitely an argument for highlighting in a different way, which for me is where the color comes in.</p>
<p>Honestly I do think we might just resolve this with either a third theme, or parallel option, to limit colors to be more monochrome.</p>

Mike, I've gone through that exercise. Having title of the card and associated actions outside that card is a bit confusing, visually requires at least more vertical space and just doesn't look solid.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think in order to keep conversations organized it's best to focus on these smaller threads about individual parts; otherwise it's very hard to focus in on details.  I think we should use this more generic thread relatively sparingly.  That said, I do have a thing to post here.</p>

<p>omg, <em>love</em> this and in particular by posting this early, this helps folks (like me) who've modified our Zulip UIs, and reduce the number of conflicts we'll experience. Specifics:</p>
<ul>
<li>agree getting rid of date dividers - they're distracting and given 24-hour usage, 11pm and 1am are more similar than 1am and 9am.</li>
<li>single compose button - yes!! send icon - yes!  compose window looks OK - seems weird to crimp the main textbox and not give users more space to write freely.</li>
<li>omg love! users-list for the current topic !!!</li>
<li>vertical bar for unread seems too subtle... i.e. doubt users will notice this and "get it"</li>
<li>yes! re shortcut help as [modifier] [key] (vs today: [modifier] + [key] )</li>
</ul>
<p>wishlist:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve the icons?  <a href="/user_uploads/2/7f/O378mThFexH_k4bO3o89bk0G/image.png">image.png</a> is cheap-looking for example, and <a href="/user_uploads/2/9/jSh6DP8bzUsGSYgAo74QM18S/image.png">image.png</a> has different sizes which again looks cheap. Also, some icons are not standard-enough (e.g. eyeball for preview) and maybe we should consider spelling them out instead?  If it's helpful/inspiring, here's what my deployment uses: <a href="/user_uploads/2/e0/ywFVW_Ys7iR0oAa6_UMoAoAU/image.png">image.png</a> <div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/7f/O378mThFexH_k4bO3o89bk0G/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/7f/O378mThFexH_k4bO3o89bk0G/image.png"></a></div><div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/9/jSh6DP8bzUsGSYgAo74QM18S/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/9/jSh6DP8bzUsGSYgAo74QM18S/image.png"></a></div><div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/e0/ywFVW_Ys7iR0oAa6_UMoAoAU/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/e0/ywFVW_Ys7iR0oAa6_UMoAoAU/image.png"></a></div></li>
<li>replace exact unread message counts when the numbers get large, e.g. "99+". Maybe have some "fun" (one click?) way to mark-unread? ideally, marking-read feels more like a fun videgame and less of a chore like it is today (two clicks with small targets)</li>
<li>more emphasis on streams, less emphasis on private/all/recent/mentions/starred - in my deployment, I've rolled this into a single line (for narrow screens): <a href="/user_uploads/2/b/7JWwEQ3HsFfTTplsaowXTY2v/image.png">image.png</a> and it's on the RHS for widescreens <a href="/user_uploads/2/bb/sYK7d1TSFESCRcawJ-LjQlmy/image.png">image.png</a><div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/b/7JWwEQ3HsFfTTplsaowXTY2v/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/b/7JWwEQ3HsFfTTplsaowXTY2v/image.png"></a></div><div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/bb/sYK7d1TSFESCRcawJ-LjQlmy/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/bb/sYK7d1TSFESCRcawJ-LjQlmy/image.png"></a></div></li>
<li>can Drafts-view be inlined like recent/all/etc ? the popup format seems weird...</li>
<li>is there a way to unify PMs and the user list ?</li>
</ul>

This is a massive / huge improvement. Many many thanks. <br>
If you would like unsolicited feedback (all minor, just “fit and finish” kind of things) they would be:</p>
<p>MAIN FEED</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I still don’t understand what it means to have a comment with a boxed blue border around it. I also don’t understand what a blue border on just the left side of a comment. Maybe remove these blue border. I’m sure they indicate something but to me, it just seems like noise. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>shouldn’t the comment form always be shown on desktop and only hidden on smaller view devices</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>PEOPLE PAIN</p>
<ul>
<li>I don’t understand what’s the difference between an Green/Brown/NoColor-empty circle. Additional, it seems weird to me that we’re inconsistent with <em>what</em> is indicating status. Is it color or is it if the circle is filled or not. Seems like we should just pick one, I’d choice having the circle filled or not to indicate status since that is most accessible (no color blind issues and it’s also more informative than having to guess what color means)</li>
</ul>
<p>STREAM PANE</p>
<ul>
<li>why does “announce” not have a # (instead uses a world globe icon(. That’s inconsistent. </li>
<li>why different colored hash tags. Seems like all other chat has figured out that having one consistent hashtag color can work</li>
</ul>

<p>That's probably a couple months away. We haven't discussed in any detail a technical plan for integration, so what I'm about to say could be wrong. But I expect it'll start with integrating a bunch of preparatory changes (e.g. adding features that appear in the new design) in parallel with isolated design changes that can be integrated independently (E.g. how the mentions look) to reduce complexity of an eventual design change pull request.</p>

<p>I don't have the attention to think about that the details of the migration until 5.0 is released, but just FYI redesigns are large projects and while it's great to see users excited about where we're going, it's going to take some time to integrate even once we've figured out all the details.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="22433">@Vlad Korobov</span> I really appreciate all the time and effort you've put into this. For my unsolicited feedback:</p>
<p>MAIN FEED:</p>
<ul>
<li>what does the reply form look like since it's not shown in this mockup?</li>
</ul>
<p>PEOPLE PAIN</p>
<ul>
<li>I still get confused why both circles and color are indicating some type of user state. There is emply/half-filled/fill circles that are 3 different states and all mean something different. Then there is Green/Brown/Grey that mean something else. Having both different circle-states and different color-states is confusing to me. It seems like we should pick <em>either</em> Circles ... or ... Color to indicate state - not both. My preference would be to just use different purple-colored circles. So a full-purple color circle, a half-filled purple circle, and an empty purple circle. All these purple circle icon styles would be similar in style to the purple icons found in the top left of the Channel (Left) Pane.</li>
</ul>
<p>LEFT PANE:</p>
<ul>
<li>I see world icons, hash tags and lock symbols all next to channel name. Very similar comment to the People Pain comment in that, it seems like we should pick just 1 thing to provide an indicator, that being either: Hashtags or Icons but not both icons and hashtags. (If it's going to be an icon, then the icons style and color should match the icons in the top left for "All Messages", "Mentions" etc). My person preference is to have the purple line-style icons for everything in the Left Pane, meaning the world icon is a purple-line style icon, ALL hashtags are purple, the lock is a purple-line style icon.</li>
</ul>

<p>what does the reply form look like since it's not shown in this mockup?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is "correction" mockup just to quickly confirm desired changes to the suggested earlier design. Simply put bug fixes and accepting some opinions about UI design because I should listen to people who used the Zulip for a long time and pick my fights <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>
<p>So, there is no Reply button here since the whole concept of a "single button" is questionable and I want to address that in a separate discussion, so I just removed out of this screen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I still get confused why both circles and color are indicating some type of user state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mike people got confused about 4 types of statuses in general. But it is not the reason to remove them, since there is a legacy audience which understand them. If we would have 2 statuses, sure we can do 2  colors like in your example. If you search in Zulip there are  conversations about it Keep in mind that in the new design there is no half-filled circle. There are online users (traditionally green) and offline users (empty circle), there are also zombie users (idle status is zombie green) and "don't talk to me users" (don't disturb is like offline but with a line inside it - this one I didn't design yet)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we should pick just 1 thing to provide an indicator</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Streams can be regular, public and private. All 3 options are indicated with an icon (#, globe, lock).</p>
<ul>
<li>Any stream traditionally can have a color, which any user can override. So if you want all of your streams to be colorless, you can do such thing in your client (for now this isn't syncing across all of clients of a single user).</li>
</ul>
<p>Your suggested design looks solid but you removed 2 big features out of the product. I'm not in the position to remove features, since I'm not Product Manager here. And to be honest I don't think that removing colors from streams and decreasing possible user statuses is an obvious improvement to the product... Yes it's making visual picture calmer... but you can change colors on your side and you can collapse both user lists to don't see those statuses at all.</p>

<p>I think the changes look good! (Apologies for the slow response!)</p>
<p>The space between paragraphs looks a little large to me, but I think it's OK if that's what we need to make it work for matching the space between messages.</p>

<p>Lets tune spacing on the implementation phase. I’l make a note about it. Its just too hard to make that change in the design</p>

<p>That comment made me think about it a bit more.<br>
Right now in Zulip font-size is 14, line-height is 17 and visual space between paragraphs is 20 (from text base line to top of x of the next line)<br>
In the suggested design font-size is 15, line-height is 19 and visual space between paragraphs is 23, which is still smaller than just an empty line of text.</p>
<p>I think its not bad, and suggest that if we feel it too much we tune than in code.</p>

It will be applied to any issues that will help make progress towards the redesign, including functionality changes we'd like to merge prior to applying the visual design changes.</p>

<p>Thanks for this update Vlad, I too have been following some of the nice redesign work you've been doing over the past few months. Do you have a conservative estimate on when some of these changes will find their way into Zulip? Are they going to be introduced bit by bit or in bulk within another major release?</p>

<p>We don't have a specific timeline, but changes will be introduced bit by bit as much as possible. (Sometimes, a change doesn't work well on its own.) We've put testing changes on hold for a few weeks as we work towards the 6.0 release, but I expect that we'll get back to testing changes here and merging them whenever they are ready as soon as the release is out. We have several PRs cued up that I expect us to be able to merge within a few weeks after the release.</p>

<p>I'm curious if there is an up-to-date version of what a potential full redesign can look like? I had a look at the Figma designs that Vlad posted but it looks like this is not fully up-to-date? At least it seems like Zulip went stronger colors for the stream headers as well as a slightly different blue focus box design. Where can I find the most up-to-date design drafts of where Zulip wants to go over the next couple releases :) ?</p>
