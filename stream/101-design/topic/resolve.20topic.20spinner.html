<p>I'm working on <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/26190">#26190</a>.</p>
<p>PR: <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/26760">#26760</a> -- contains demo videos implementing spinners.</p>
<p>Regarding this statement in the issue description of <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/26190">#26190</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We should make sure that if you're in an interleaved view, we do this (show spinners) with all of the topic bars for the topic in question,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think a better way would be to disable options in other topic bars, because as we show spinners while a request is in progress, if a user edits and resolves a topic in an interleaved view and both requests are in progress, the user will see two adjacent spinners on all the related topic bars, which is not a good UI, right?</p>

<p>I see a somewhat related discussion in <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="101" href="/#narrow/stream/101-design/topic/hide.20topic.20editing.20pencil.20in.20interleaved.20views.3F">#design &gt; hide topic editing pencil in interleaved views?</a> </p>
<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="22433">Vlad Korobov</span> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The proposal we’ve discussed in the past is to show buttons in recipient bar only when in that topic view + possible to show those buttons in other view on hover. That was UI clean up. But if we think that those buttons could be misguiding without the full context of the topic we could have only one button in interleaved view “go to the full version of that topic”.</p>

<p>So, I think we can integrate <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/26760">#26760</a> and a separate PR to handle the behaviour (TBD) of all the options in the interleaved view?</p>
