<p>Hi, I wanted to discuss about the UI of issue <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/9228" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/9228">#9228</a>.  : )<br>
This is about displaying the specific streams which does not match with the 5 stream message notification settings defined by the user in the <code>#settings/notifications</code> page. Few ideas I had in mind are:-</p>
<p>Since the notification settings are basically booleans, I was thinking of adding a cross button, clicking it would mean accepting the global settings for that notification and that stream would get removed.</p>
<p>Also, for organisations with many streams listing many unmatched streams for would be a problem. So we could reuse the popup button beside <code>New stream notifications:</code> text in the <code>#organization/organization-settings</code> page and maybe add the cross button beside each unmatched stream.<br>
This would be done for all the 5 stream message notification settings. </p>
<p>I also had a question about where to place the unmatched notification lines:-</p>
<ul>
<li>below the <code>Change notification settings for individual streams on your Streams page.</code> line that is under the global settings.</li>
<li>or at the end of the page where slack puts it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also we could just place the stream exceptions buttons beside each checkbox lines. But it seems there are plans to change the layout of the checkboxes on notifications tab to a grid structure (<a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/12182" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/12182">#12182</a>).</p>
<p>Added the GIF for how <code>slack</code> does it for reference.....<br>

<p>I think a cross button to restore a setting to its default value is great and part of what I'd had in mind for this issue.</p>

<p>I think it's unlikely that a user will have a ton of streams with different settings than that user's defaults, but totally possible.</p>

<p>I think with the grid structure we've proposed for the global notification settings, one could easily fit each setting into a single row, e.g.</p>
<p><code>#streamname  [ ]    [ ]    [ ]     [  ]     [ ]      x</code></p>

<p>We could reasonably prototype a grid structure for these elements and then do the larger effort of converting the existing settings to use that later (or focus on the grid structure fix first?).</p>
