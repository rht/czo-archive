<p>Kicking off a separate thread regarding this:</p>

<p>I think that's probably a useful step, though I'll note that we do not intend for user groups to have long descriptions, so the screenshot is kinda misleading. In general I want to do a more holistic redesign of the user groups setting UI to perhaps be more similar to the two-panel "Stream settings" UI, so I don't want to necessarily go too deep into tweaking the current system.</p>
<p>I guess in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to be able to browse user groups using filters etc. like our other table-based components.</li>
<li>We want the set of members for user groups to be browsable like stream subscribers.</li>
<li>We want to be able to support multiple screens worth of user group settings, such as a list of permissions the group has.</li>
<li>We want to be able to browse subgroups.</li>
</ul>

<p>The broader context is that in <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19525">#19525</a> we plan to make user groups much more powerful, and we'll need a UI for viewing and managing the new functionality.</p>

<p>A proposal is to make the groups management UI similar to the stream management UI, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>List of groups on the left, with two tabs (all groups, and groups to which the user belongs).</li>
<li>Right-side panel for viewing and managing a specific group.</li>
<li>Tabs within the right-side panel for the things <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="7">Tim Abbott</span> mentioned above, i.e. something like "General", "Personal", "Permissions", and "Subscribers".</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll spend more time to hammer out the specifics after 5.0, but do folks think the general direction makes sense?</p>

<p>Without getting too much into the weeds of actual solutions, I 100% agree we can make this experience better, and as others have alluded to, we have other UI that we can emulate here.</p>
