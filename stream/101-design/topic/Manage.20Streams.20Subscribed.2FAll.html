<p>I believe we should change the <code>Subscribed | All</code> paradigm in Manage Streams.  It doesn't support a very common use case of wanting to subscribe to new streams.  The current approach forces you to switch tabs, and then the "All" table is still cluttered with your existing subscriptions</p>

<p>We have clumsy code that makes them sticky.  You can see this now if you unsubscribe in our current <code>Subscribed</code> tab.</p>

<p>I think it would be ideal that if you subscribed to a stream, we just popped up some kind of modal to confirm your subscription and let you choose what to do next:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>You have subscribed to social!

[Subscribe to more streams] [View social] [Go back to ...]
</code></pre></div>

</blockquote>
<p>I actually think that's the most common way people subscribe to streams -- I'd expect for our category of app that the average user subscribes via this UI to more streams the first time they visit the "Manage streams" page with intent to subscribe, as they do in their entire time using the app for the next like 3 years.  (In part because a substantial amount of new subscriptions come from other users creating streams and adding others to them).  Whether or not you agree with that precise statement, I certainly think we should optimize for the use case of subscribing to several streams in a sequence, since "browsing and then subscribing" feels like a common thing to want to do.</p>

<p>So should we go with the simplest <code>Unsubscribed | Subscribed</code>proposal then?  We can keep the rows sticky if you subscribe/unsubscribe (like we already do for the current Subscribed tab).  And we can postpone the discussion on modals for now.</p>

<p>Thinking about <code>Unsubscribed | Subscribed</code>, preserving the current stick behavior that we have: I think that'd be pretty good for normal users.  It might be kinda annoying for organization administrators, who might be looking to just "See the top N high-traffic streams", which we'd be making difficult with that UI change.</p>

<p>Can we add an "All" tab for admins?  It seems like we're making the most common use case difficult here to support a few edge cases.</p>

<p>Yeah, that's fair.  I personally think the admin use case is a bit contrived.  If admins want to monitor which streams are getting lots of subscribers or weekly traffic, we should probably do that on the /stats page.  Or just let them deal with the two tabs.</p>
