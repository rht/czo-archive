<p>I think we should do some restructuring of this system to at least place the error in the block with the content and have it disappear as soon as you start editing the fields again; ideally, we'd also use a better visual style (e.g. the text in red just below the text box and the text box that needs to change highlighted in red).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="131">@Rishi Gupta</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="7">@Tim Abbott</span> I want to discuss how we have planned to show errors. From above comment, my understanding here is that we want to show errors for each subsection in the corresponding block rather than on top of the page. If this is right, how we want to present this error i.e. in a button, any bootstrap element or else.</p>
<p>And for the ideal case mentioned I think it is not possible to implement it because we don't get information that on changing which property we got the error. (The solution here will be to do again a complete restructure of settings and implement something like what slack have implemented i.e. save each setting individually).</p>

<p>I tihnk just red text (not in a button) is fine. We can remove the error and replace with the "Save changes"/"Cancel" button once any of the fields in the section are changed?</p>

<p>Yeah, I agree, red text is fine.</p>
