<p>I would like to redesign the Organization Profile Page. I felt like the User profile is well structured and elements arranged properly but in Organization profile elements are not well structured <br>
I did some design <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/GLG0AuCS3gVWBIHCI0IeG7/new-project?node-id=0%3A1">figma Design</a><br>
changes <br>
1) Org Profile picture is in the right corner exactly like user Profile Picture and gets rid of button and upload triggered by clicking on the widget itself, deletion using X icon exactly like User Avatar deletion<br>
2)Organization Description box size decreased since it occupies more space even the description in very less which can be an auto-increment in size based on the length of the description<br>
3) Separated Day Mode and night mode Organization logo<br>
4) Removed logo upload button and delete logo button.upload logo triggered by clicking on the logo respectively and  deletion using "X" icon</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="14329">@Jagan S</span> interesting thoughts!  A few thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure about the organization icon idea; the thing is, organization icons are never displayed at a large size like the user avatar is, and we expect a resolution of ~100x100; so I think it will basically always look bad/pixelated.  </li>
<li>The organization logo stuff is nice, but we'll need to make sure it falls back properly in the event that the window is narrow</li>
<li>For "organization description", what I'd really like to do is show the rendered-markdown description by default, and only if the user clicks an edit widget should it switch to an editable mode (which could be in a modal or something).</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="7">@Tim Abbott</span>   for organization icon, I mainly cared about the position of the organization icon we could reduce the size. is it ok to place the organization icon widget in the right corner?</p>

<p>We can try it; I'd want to look at a screenshot for whether it looks broken.</p>

<p>Also, I think having a larger description box is a good idea, because it encourages longer descriptions... But I don't think it's a hard requirement.</p>

<p>With my proposed change, the sizing of the description box would be driven mainly by how it looks when displayed on the login page.</p>
