<p>Hello designers at Zulip,</p>
<p>I am Chetan Manda, a final year undergraduate student from IIT Guwahati, India.<br>
I came across Zulip on the Gsoc website and I went through your open source work and found it really interesting. <br>
I am a designer and I specialize in User Interface and User Experience design(UI/UX).<br>
I have interned at various companies during the last four years and have executed end to end projects while interacting with key stakeholders, product managers, and developers.Here's a list of things that I do:<br>
• Conduct User Research, develop low - high-fidelity wireframes, storyboards, user flows, screen flows, sitemaps, UI artefacts, prototyping, and Usability testing.<br>
• Create exceptional user experiences for end-users and design internal/external user-facing products ensuring they are useful and usable by end-users.  <br>
• Translate the concepts and agreed ideas into artwork and designs that bring simplicity and user-friendliness to complex design roadblocks.   <br>
• Basic CSS, HTML<br>
Here are a few of my works : <a href="https://www.behance.net/ChetanManda" target="_blank" title="https://www.behance.net/ChetanManda">https://www.behance.net/ChetanManda</a></p>
<p>I would love to work for your organization on any projects/tickets that I could help out on based on my abilities. I can put in 35-40 hours per work with proper dedication throughout the Summer and I am capable of learning new languages at a pretty fast pace. I would be really grateful if you could recommend any relevant project &amp; mentor for me. Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Chetan<br>

<p>Welcome to Zulip! I'd really interesting to hear what kind of insights you have for us with reference to Zulip's design.<br>
I think the best direction of action would be to just start conversations (topics in <a class="stream" data-stream-id="101" href="/#narrow/stream/101-design">#design</a> ) about where you think we could have changes/improvements... We also have some existing frontend issues that could use help with code, if you're interested in that.</p>
