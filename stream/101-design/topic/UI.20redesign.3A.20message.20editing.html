<p>Here are some thoughts on the message editing UI (from <a href="https://zulip-compose-decomposed.vladkorobov.repl.co/">https://zulip-compose-decomposed.vladkorobov.repl.co/</a>).</p>
<p><a href="/user_uploads/2/e0/zHKdQsocV7tsEXNFRmUbf59M/Screen-Shot-2023-04-24-at-8.10.12-AM.png">Screen-Shot-2023-04-24-at-8.10.12-AM.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/2/e0/zHKdQsocV7tsEXNFRmUbf59M/Screen-Shot-2023-04-24-at-8.10.12-AM.png" title="Screen-Shot-2023-04-24-at-8.10.12-AM.png"><img src="/user_uploads/2/e0/zHKdQsocV7tsEXNFRmUbf59M/Screen-Shot-2023-04-24-at-8.10.12-AM.png"></a></div><ol>
<li>As <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="22433">Vlad Korobov</span> noted when we chatted, we currently have a somewhat odd situation where the message action buttons are hidden in the message editing UI, but the keyboard shortcuts for them still work. (Note <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="9" href="/#narrow/stream/9-issues/topic/message.20actions.20popover.20in.20weird.20position">#issues &gt; message actions popover in weird position</a> for the menu keyboard shortcut.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on feedback from <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="7">Tim Abbott</span> , it would be quite a pain from an engineering perspective to specifically disable all the keyboard shortcuts in that state. From a UX perspective, I kind of think you should just edit your message and then take other actions when you're done, but I also don't think it's super important. So for consistency between the keyboard and mouse user options, it would probably be best to show the action buttons in this state.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>I haven't tried to verify, but <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="7">Tim Abbott</span> 's recollection is that we used to show emoji reactions in the message editing view (below the Cancel / Save buttons), and that it's an accidental result of refactoring that we currently don't. In any case, it probably makes sense to show them? That will be helpful if we want to keep the keyboard shortcuts for adding/removing emoji working; currently you can use these shortcuts, but can't see that anything happened until you're done editing the message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It seem like we should show the message length limit indicator, same as in the compose box? We currently just don't let you type more characters once you've hit the limit, without providing any info as to what's going on.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This part is definitely just a bug/oversight; <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19535">https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/19535</a> is the prior work on that. Someone looking for a project could pick that up.</p>

<p>I filed a brief issue (Show message length limit indicator in the "edit message" UI <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/25271">#25271</a>) so that we don't lose track.</p>

<p>I claimed the project on the github issue you linked. However, I have not been assigned the task by the zulipbot companion yet. Would you know the reason for this?</p>

<p>Good day!</p>
<p>I took some time since I had other responsibilities, but I just now made a pull request to fix this issue: <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/25460">https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/25460</a></p>
<p>Perhaps you or someone else can look at it and let me know what you think of it? Changes, thoughts on the code in general. </p>
<p>I have one question though, my Pr is not linked to the original issue request here: <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/25271">https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/25271</a>. Is this a problem? How do I fix that?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>
